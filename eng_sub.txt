1	Okay where were we?
2	It was June of 2006,
3	and life had just taken an unexpected turn.
4	Dad, can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom?
5	I feel like you've been talking for like a year.
6	Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important.
7	It's all part of the story.
8	- Could I go to the bathroom? - No.
9	The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful.
10	For me, it started out great.
11	In fact, day one was amazing.
12	I'd finally gotten together with Robin.
13	But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life,
14	your uncle Marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his.
15	So that's it?
16	We're breaking up?
17	Marshall, I'm sorry. I just...
18	I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and
19	-and figure out who I am outside of us.
20	And the only way that I can do that is if...
21	if we don't talk for a while.
22	For a while.
23	Try never, okay?
24	You walk out that door, and we're done.
25	You're never going to hear my voice again.
26	I should call her.
27	- No, No. - Ted it is--
28	If you call her when she asked you not to you're just going to look weak
29	and you're going to regret it.
30	Now, listen, whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first.
31	And I will punch you in the face.
32	You're a good friend, Ted.
33	Hey.
34	So, did you hear the big news?
35	You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up,
36	and Lily's gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night,
37	yeah, I think he knows.
38	Oh, my God.
39	I-I'm so sorry. Wh--
40	What happened?
41	Well, she left.
42	And I don't even know if she's coming back.
43	I didn't get your message until I woke up.
44	- Bro, I am so sorry. - Thanks.
45	I know it must be tough,
46	but are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better,
47	but will actively excite you?
48	Sure.
49	For the first time, ever, the three of us are single at the same time.
50	I've dreamed about this day, boys, and it's going to be legendary.
51	Together, we will own this city.
52	Anytime a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriends,
53	we'll be there.
54	Anytime a girl wants to solve her father issues
55	through promiscuity and binge drinking, we will be there.
56	Anytime a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo,
57	sticking their heads out the sunroof shouting,
58	"What's up, New York?"
59	we will be what is up New York.
60	Gentlemen, we are about to embark on...
61	Aw, man, you guys did it, didn't you?
62	Transcripts : Raceman Subtitles : Willow's Team www.forom.com
63	One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning...
64	...and love is ending, the first 30 days are remarkably similar.
65	For one thing, you spend most of your time in bed.
66	Your friends can't stand to listen to you.
67	It was a really beautiful song.
68	So... stupid, man.
69	And you never seem to wear pants.
70	- Hey, Marshall. - Hey, Ted.
71	You hungry?
72	What's the point? I could eat some food.
73	It's just going to leave me.
74	Well, at least in that scenario you get to do the dumping.
75	Come on, it's Sunday. It's pancakes day.
76	Lily always made the pancakes.
77	God, I loved her pancakes.
78	So soft. So warm.
79	So perfectly shaped.
80	Are we still talking about her pancakes?
81	Come on, you got to eat something; what can I get you?
82	- Beer. - No, that's what you had for dinner.
83	Fine.
84	Then I'll just have leftovers.
85	So, he stays home all the time not getting laid?
86	No, see, that's what you do when you have a fiancée.
87	He should be down here celebrating. He's free.
88	He got that redheaded tumor removed.
89	You should write and illustrate children's books.
90	You know what Marshall needs to do.
91	He needs to stop being sad.
92	When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead.
93	True story.
94	It's only been a month.
95	He just needs to go at his own pace.
96	Anyway,  Lily's the one who caused this whole mess.
97	Hey, cut her some slack.
98	She's our friend, too. She's just trying to figure out who she is.
99	Figure out who she is?
100	Yeah, she should call me; I got a whole list.
101	She's selfish. She's immature. She's...
102	What?
103	God, your eyes are so blue.
104	Teddy Bear.
105	Oh that's a...
106	Yeah, it was hard to feel too bad.
107	I was dating the woman of my dreams, and things were going great.
108	Well, for the most part.
109	So, I found her shampoo.
110	I guess she left it here.
111	It smells like her.
112	Like lavender and seashells and hope.
113	Somehow, erotic and comforting all at the same time.
114	That's  my shampoo.
115	Oh, sorry.
116	Mmm, I thought he'd never go to sleep.
117	- Uh-oh. - Already?
118	He's calling her.
119	- I don't hear any-- - He's calling her.
120	No.
121	Okay, you're right, I won't call her.
122	I will not call her.
123	Well, I called her.
124	And get this, she changed her number.
125	What, like I'm going to stalk her, or something?
126	Like she's so special.
127	Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there.
128	'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone,
129	and they all seem a lot better than her
130	based on the brief conversations I had with them.
131	- Does he know I'm in here? - Yeah, hey, Robin.
132	- Anyways, one of the Lily Aldrins said... - This has to stop.
133	Ted, we just started dating.
134	We agreed we don't want to move too fast,
135	and yet somehow, we have a baby.
136	He can't feed himself.
137	- He cries a lot, he keeps us up all night. - Have you tried breast-feeding?
138	Nailed it!
139	Look, they were together nine years.
140	It's  only been a month and a half.
141	He just needs to go at his own pace.
142	He slept on our floor last night, Ted.
143	- He watched a scary movie. - It is time for some tough love.
144	We need to get him out of that apartment.
145	He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine.
146	Mmm, sunshine.
147	Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Sunshine.
148	All right, I really don't think this is going to help.
149	Do you know why you're not over Lily yet?
150	It's 'cause you can still picture her naked.
151	You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs;
152	it's a scientific fact.
153	The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images or "b-pegs".
154	And your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's.
155	There are a lot of them.
156	Well, they won't go away until you overwrite them
157	with images of other women's boobs.
158	Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs,
159	so we begin here tonight, my friend.
160	Two at a time.
161	Those count as four.
162	Yeah.
163	This is fun right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day.
164	The Indians are winning.
165	I got to admit, it is really nice to be outside.
166	Yankee fans, please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision for a special
167	- seventh-inning-stretch surprise - Oh, no.
168	It's all a big lie!
169	She's just going to break your heart.
170	You can drag me out of here, but she has no soul!
171	We've tried everything-- baseball, strippers.
172	The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.
173	I think he's beyond repair.
174	See, this is the problem with guys.
175	You don't know how to deal with heartbreak.
176	Oh, and what's your prescription, Dr. Estrogen?
177	Eat Haagen-Dazs and watch Love Actually, till your periods sync up.
178	Yeah, that's the stuff.
179	Oh, my God.
180	How long have you been doing this?
181	Well, my dad taught me to shoot when I was a kid.
182	Whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here,
183	and it reminds me that... guns are fun.
184	Um, you know, Ted is kind of against guns.
185	And that's why Ted's never going to find out about this.
186	Whoa, that sounded kind of scary with me holding a gun, didn't it?
187	No, I-I just mean, please don't tell Ted.
188	You want to try?
189	Only hell yeah.
190	Oh, yeah, yeah, this is what I needed.
191	I felt so powerless this whole time, but this...
192	this is power. This is...
193	I should of mentioned the recoil.
194	I got to hand it to you, when he got home, Marshall was smiling--
195	did you sleep with him?
196	'Cause I was actually, like, three days away from suggesting that.
197	Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side.
198	- Yeah, yeah! - Well, congratulations.
199	You're the first person to cheer him up all summer.
200	- You win. - Oh, what do I win?
201	I'll tell you what you win: I'm taking you away this weekend.
202	You are? That's so nice.
203	Yeah, my aunt and uncle have a beach house out in Montauk,
204	oh, it's really romantic.
205	My uncle's had like three affairs there.
206	Wow, must be a nice house, I've seen pictures of your uncle.
207	This is going to be so great.
208	We'll finally get some time alone.
209	Are you sure Marshall's going to be okay with this?
210	Yeah, absolutely. Dude, I'm doing much better.
211	In fact, take my car.
212	- Really? - Yeah.
213	Hey, thanks... and, hey,
214	if you need anything day or night, just call me--
215	You know what, please don't call me.
216	What? What's wrong?
217	It's, uh, Lily's credit card bill.
218	She must have forgotten to switch her address.
219	So?
220	So, I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there in San Francisco.
221	No. No, no good can come from looking at this.
222	- You've made too much progress already. - I know but I just, maybe the--
223	No!
224	You're going to thank me for this.
225	You're a good friend, Ted.
226	August 5th, one charge-- tickets.
227	To what? George Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars.
228	August 10th, one charge: Tennis Emporium.
229	August 18th, two charges: Mario's Bistro
230	and, get this, Pet Palace.
231	You guys see what this means, right?
232	Wow, Mario's Bistro.
233	What a perfect place to whore around.
234	Only the best for my little Lily pad.
235	Oh, funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert
236	and dragged me on stage to dance with you Courtney Cox-style.
237	And I'm so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.
238	You know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years,
239	but I didn't do it, because I never truly loved him.
240	I got you a gift.
241	Oh ! A ferret.
242	Oh, I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace.
243	Oh, I've always wanted one,
244	but Marshall had this secret phobia of ferrets.
245	I bet that's something he made you promise not to tell nobody.
246	It was.
247	Oh.
248	I love you, funk legend George Clinton.
249	I love you, too, Lily.
250	That's right, Marshall, she's all mine.
251	Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.
252	# Ow, we want the funk. #
253	# Give up the funk... #
254	That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
255	Yeah, why are you afraid of ferrets? They're adorable.
256	Because, Robin, they're like fuzzy, tube-shaped rats.
257	Plus, those charges are from, like, a month ago.
258	Exactly.
259	For new charges, you have to go to her online account.
260	You  can see credit card activity from, like, two hours ago.
261	But, you know, don't.
262	Why do you talk? Why do you talk?!
263	He needs her password. It's not like he has her password.
264	Ooh, this is good, he has her password.
265	There's a charge from earlier today: the Kellett Hotel on 5th.
266	I don't believe this. Lily's back in New York.
267	I can't believe this.
268	Lily's in New York?
269	I-I guess I've been thinking when she got back, she'd call me.
270	That's really the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.
271	This has been "holding it together"?
272	Okay, you know what? I'm calling her.
273	- No. - Ted, give me the phone.
274	You're not calling her, this changes nothing.
275	You, come here.
276	Look, while we're away this weekend, can you keep an eye on him,
277	make sure he doesn't call that hotel?
278	You want me to babysit him?
279	20 bucks.
280	An hour.
281	And money for pizza.
282	Uh, yeah, how about you do it for free or every time we hang out, you have to watch this?
283	Come here.
284	- My little blue-eyed baby, baby lips. - Ooh, ooh, sugar, sugar...
285	Okay,  I'll do it! Stop being a couple.
286	- Marshall. - Marshall, Marshall!
287	Ted, I know I shouldn't do this, but I have to!
288	- You call her... - We were together...
289	- for nine years! - ...and everything we've been working so hard for
290	is completely flushed down the toi...
291	Hello, Lily Aldrin's room, please.
292	Thank you.
293	- Hang up now. - Ted, I can't hang up now.
294	- Hang up now. - The missiles are in the air,
295	- and I know that you don't approve. - Hang up.
296	Hello.
297	Uh, a guy answered.
298	There's-there's a guy in her room.
299	- I'm going down there. - Dude, you can't do that.
300	I have to go down there, and I have to tell her I love her;
301	I have to beg her to take me back,
302	even if I have to get down on my knees.
303	- Marshall, you can't do that. - Oh, really, why not?
304	56 days.
305	That's how long it took me to get right about here.
306	Because you're pathetic!
307	I'm sorry, but right now, you are not Marshall.
308	You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall,
309	and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily.
310	You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line.
311	Marshall.
312	The real Marshall.
313	But if you go down there right now like this,
314	you're going to blow it for him, and he's never going to forgive you.
315	Of  course, whatever I say, you're just going to do the opposite, so
316	have a great weekend. Good luck screwing up your life.
317	Come on, Robin.
318	Is it still okay if we borrow the car?
319	Bold. Bold to go for the car.
320	What?
321	I didn't say a thing.
322	You think I was too hard on him.
323	I didn't say a thing.
324	I can't believe you're accusing me of being too hard on him.
325	You're the one who said "tough love."
326	Yeah, tough love, not "hand the guy a noose."
327	Oh, but it's okay to hand him a nine millimeter?
328	Yeah, he told me.
329	So you're a gun nut?
330	No, I'm a gun enthusiast.
331	- Do you know how many people... - The Second Amendment...
332	- are killed each year in accidents... - protects my right to bear arms...
333	All right, all right, all right.
334	I was too hard on him.
335	A little.
336	I'm going to call Barney, see how they're doing.
337	Go for Barney.
338	Oh, hey, where are you guys?
339	We're at a fundraiser, helping young women raise money for community college.
340	Strip club, nice.
341	Is Marshall okay?
342	Yeah, he's here and he's great. Uh, hang on.
343	Marshall? Tell Ted that--
344	Uh-oh.
345	Already?
346	What? What uh-oh?
347	He's gone.
348	You lost him?
349	I can't believe this. He's gonna go down to that hotel.
350	Crap, you're right. Okay, okay, here's the plan, here's the plan.
351	You go down to the hotel and find him.
352	I'll stay here and get a lap dance. On three. One, two...
353	Barney!
354	Was there a hot tub at your uncle's place?
355	A really nice one.
356	Hi, uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in?
357	Marshall.
358	Hey.
359	What happened?
360	Well, I went up to Lily's floor,
361	and I had this little speech in my head--
362	everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect.
363	I knocked on the door.
364	So you knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?
365	Yeah.
366	It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.
367	What? Who-- who was it?
368	His name was Joey Adalian,
369	although he went by a number of aliases in his years as an identity thief.
370	Apparently, earlier in the summer...
371	Oh, this is so embarrassing.
372	I-I could have sworn I had some change.
373	I know, I know. I'm sorry.
374	Oh, here we go.
375	No, that's-that's a button.
376	It was a button.
377	- Do you, uh, take credit cards? - Yes, I do.
378	So Lily's not back in town, and she doesn't have a boyfriend?
379	Th-That's good news, right?
380	Yeah.
381	I don't know.
382	Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her.
383	I don't know where she is or what she's doing.
384	She was my whole life, man, and now she's-she's gone.
385	You know, first day of college, I showed up,
386	I was so freaked out, and-and I got up to my room, and there was my roommate,
387	lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall.
388	Had headphones on, big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap.
389	Happy.
390	Confident.
391	Not afraid of anything.
392	That guy was you.
393	You before you met Lily.
394	Ted?
395	Yeah?
396	I was high that day.
397	I was. I was so high, I thought you were the dean.
398	Wh-What I'm saying is there's a version of you without Lily, and it's not this.
399	You can't let Lily steal your identity the way that guy stole hers.
400	Okay.
401	Okay, resolved.
402	Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being okay.
403	- Cheers. - Cheers.
404	But he wasn't, 'cause that's not how life works.
405	The next day, he found one of her socks or something,
406	and we were back to square one.
407	And then, one morning...
408	Ted, I think you should see this.
409	Oh, no, what now?
410	Marshall, what are you doing?
411	It's Sunday.
412	It's pancakes day.
413	It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes...
414	So good.
415	So good.
416	...but Marshall had come back from the dead.
417	Because while baseball, strippers, and guns can help,
418	the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.
419	# I try to laugh about it #
420	# Cover it all up with lies #
421	# I try to laugh about it #
422	# Hiding the tears from my eyes #
423	# 'Cause boys don't cry. #
424	Marshall and Lily had been together for nine wonderful years,
425	until she dumped him and ran off to San Francisco.
426	The healing process was taking a long time.
427	Then, one night, he made a giant leap forward.
428	All right, I'll see you guys later.
429	I'll walk you out.
430	See ya.
431	You just checked out Robin's ass.
432	What? No! No, Barney, I was...
433	Dude, that's awesome.
434	You're finally forgetting about that short redhead.
435	Lily.
436	Yes, Lily. Thank you. That was going to drive me crazy all night.
437	Hey, Ted, Marshall just checked out your girlfriend's ass.
438	- I did not, Ted, I... - That's awesome.
439	You're finally getting better.
440	This is the moment I've been waiting for.
441	Starting tonight, I am going to teach you how to live.
442	Ted, you had your chance. You're out; Marshall's in.
443	- Yes! - Oh, God.
444	Marshall, being a single guy in New York City is like...
445	What's something everybody likes?
446	Candy.
447	Yes, it's like being in a candy store.
448	You just walk right in and grab yourself some Whoppers.
449	Yeah.
450	Is Whoppers the best one?
451	Mounds.
452	Milk Duds.
453	Gobstoppers.
454	This went on for another hour;
455	I'll just skip to the end.
456	- Dubble Bubbles. - Nice!
457	Marshall. We're doing this.
458	I am not taking no for an answer.
459	Fine.
460	Hey, Robin. Marshall checked out your ass.
461	Ted, what is wrong with you?
462	He checked out my ass.
463	Hey, tell him thanks. I felt like I was having a bad ass day.
464	Cool, see ya.
465	Lily.
466	It is a great ass.
467	None of us had seen Lily in three months.
468	There were so many unanswered questions,
469	so many things to say.
470	Your hair is adorable.
471	Meanwhile, Barney was taking Marshall out to meet women
472	for the first time since he was 17.
473	Hi. Have you met Marshall?
474	- Hi. - Hi.
475	Look how sweaty my hands are.
476	It's weird, right? Uh, sweat?
477	Like, this smelly water coming out of your skin.
478	It was nice meeting you.
479	I-I-I hate to interrupt, but, uh,
480	do you like magic?
481	Um, I guess.
482	Oh, my God!
483	Anyway, Marshall here is awesome.
484	Salad in a bag? His idea.
485	Dude! You were awesome last night.
486	You were charming, you were funny,
487	you were totally working that girl.
488	You went home with her.
489	Yes, I did.
490	But she told me that if it wasn't for me,
491	you would have had a shot with her,
492	so, in hypothetical terms, you scored last night.
493	All right!
494	Hypothetical high five.
495	Nice.
496	All right. Tonight, we're going to go to the bar...
497	Barney, no, I am not going out with you ever again.
498	Come on! I'll, I'll teach you all of my strategies.
499	Oh, really?
500	My favorite, number seven:
501	create a mystery about yourself.
502	That way, they become so intrigued, they have to hang out with you all night.
503	Oh, come on, does that really work?
504	Maybe it does, and maybe it doesn't.
505	Damn it, that's intriguing. Okay, I'm in.
506	- I have something you've got to hear. - You will not believe what just happened.
507	You go first.
508	I found a 1939d penny on the subway.
509	Just imagine the kind of history this little copper guy...
510	Lily's back in town.
511	And you let me go first?
512	Have you seen her?
513	Yeah. I actually went apartment-hunting with her today.
514	How's she doing?
515	You're not going to like it.
516	I am doing great.
517	This summer, best thing ever!
518	San Francisco is so happening right now.
519	She's  happy?!
520	Marshall had the worst summer of his life, and she's happy.
521	Yeah, and I suppose her art program was all fulfilling or whatever.
522	Oh. The art program-- best thing ever.
523	Oh, my God.
524	This is your best work.
525	In all my years teaching, I've never seen anything so...
526	Needless to say, this is art.
527	I can't teach you anything.
528	But the best part of S.F.--
529	Oh, that's what we call San Francisco--
530	the people.
531	Even just riding around on the bus all summer.
532	It was like a human tapestry.
533	Hi, I'm Mike.
534	I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure-traveler writer.
535	I'm Paula. I sing in a punk band for children.
536	Yeah.
537	I'm  Dan, I'm a neurosurgeon.
538	You are stunning, by the way.
539	Wow. I'm so happy for you.
540	Oh, she's such a...
541	After what she did to Marshall, she should come back here devastated,
542	crawling on all fours over the broken glass of her own shame and regret.
543	You never chose sides. I respect that.
544	She's unbelievable. Unbelievable.
545	Unbelievable? What's unbelievable?
546	Oh. Listen, Marshall.
547	Ted found a penny on the subway, and it's old, and that's interesting.
548	Way to go.
549	Okay, first of all, that is interesting.
550	Second, we have to tell him.
551	No, we don't. He's just starting to get better, going out with Barney.
552	I mean, how do you think he's going to feel when he hears Lily's moved on?
553	- She's moved on? - It happens.
554	I've fallen out of love faster than that before,
555	sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever.
556	One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me.
557	But we're great.
558	Honey.
559	Now, let's review Barney's rules for mating without dating.
560	Lesson two, corollary five.
561	Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive
562	and she'll be putty in your hands.
563	Excellent.  Have you chosen your entree?
564	I have. Sweet brunette, eight o'clock.
565	Nine o'clock. Ten... thirty.
566	She's walking to the bar.
567	- Her? Really? - Yeah.
568	No, you're right. Ambition is the enemy of success.
569	Okay. Hit it.
570	What's the matter, four eyes, you got astigmatism or something?
571	I'm sorry, I was trying to playfully disarm you,
572	but I just got out of a long relationship.
573	I have no idea what I'm doing.
574	I'm Marshall.
575	Hi, Marshall. Amy.
576	Don't worry. I've been there.
577	Hold on.
578	Nice recovery. I think it's working.
579	Um, Amy. This is my friend, Barney.
580	Barney, this is Amy.
581	Hi, Barney. Nice to meet you.
582	Hi.
583	Amy, do you like... magic?
584	- I hate you. - I am so sorry.
585	It's a sickness. I'm the real victim here.
586	Twice.
587	Twice in a row, you took my candy. That was my candy.
588	- I know, but tonight... - No. Forget it.
589	You're such a jackass.
590	I thought you were gonna call me a jerk.
591	All right, I'm sorry. I will make it up to you.
592	Tonight, we'll go to a college bar near NYU--
593	The Scorpion and the Toad.
594	I figure in a younger crowd you'll seem more mature, more worldly
595	and, as a third-year law student, more smarter.
596	Okay, but no magic.
597	How did you do that?
598	I'm taking a leak, dumb ass.
599	The next day, Robin and I went apartment-hunting with aunt Lily.
600	But I need the freedom to really chase my passion,
601	which was painting, but now I think it's music
602	or spoken word-- maybe both.
603	God! Isn't life amazing?
604	It is so great to see you, Ted.
605	I'm going to get the key from the lockbox.
606	What?
607	She's miserable. She's realized she's made a huge mistake.
608	Her and Marshall will be back together in a week. I love it!
609	Um, no. You just want Lily to be miserable.
610	The truth is, she's happy.
611	Trust me. I've known Lily for nine years.
612	Trust me. I'm a girl.
613	Yeah, but you're Canadian.
614	- Why do you always have to bring that up? - You're our weird neighbors to the north.
615	- You bring it up every time. - Five bucks says she still wants Marshall.
616	You're on.
617	Five American bucks.
618	Damn it.
619	Okay, so how do we get the truth out of her.
620	Tequila. It's her weakness.
621	Three shots, she'll tell you the truth about anything.
622	I hope this is my new home.
623	Yeah, I'm going to take that first apartment.
624	Marshall Eriksen, suit up!
625	No way.
626	Yeah, you're good in that.
627	- Let's go. - Wait.
628	Empty your pockets.
629	Come on.
630	- Come on, let's... - Sleeves.
631	- There is nothing in my... - Oh, is that right?
632	Let's go.
633	- Behind my ear. - There is nothing behind your...
634	Yeah, I'm in pre-law. The workload's killing me, though.
635	Oh, tell me about it. I'm third year at Columbia Law, so...
636	if the workload does kill you, I can probably get a conviction.
637	Yeah.
638	You must be majoring in chemistry,
639	'cause what I'm picking up between us is, uh...
640	College lesbian phase.
641	Listen, I got to go, but it'd be great to see you again.
642	Yes, it would.
643	It really would.
644	Well, maybe I'll see you here sometime.
645	Probably not. I'm never here, so...
646	You know, I do have a phone number.
647	Great.
648	Nice.
649	- Hi, I'm Barney. - Oh, no.
650	Do you... mind giving my friend  your phone number?
651	Sure.
652	Whoo!
653	I did it! I got a girl's phone number.
654	Oh, and her handwriting is so cute, look.
655	Oh, I'm gonna take her out for Chinesr food
656	and then maybe we'll walk through the park.
657	It'll be so... what?
658	Sorry, buddy, I'm taking this one, too.
659	I'll kill you!
660	And then, I discovered this area, North Beach.
661	Best beach ever!
662	Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer.
663	How are you guys doing?
664	And hey, how's Marshall?
665	- Give me the card! - I'm not giving you any card.
666	- I swear...! - You are not getting...!
667	Terrific.
668	That is so good to hear. Oh, hold on.
669	This could be about the apartment.
670	Okay, we're way past truth-telling-Lilly
671	and about to hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998-Lilly
672	and I'm not cleaning that up again.
673	So, congratulations, you win.
674	She's happy.
675	I didn't get it.
676	That first apartment, I...
677	I waited too long and...
678	somebody else got it.
679	Interesting.
680	Wow, Lily, you, uh...
681	seem to be having a pretty strong reaction on losing an apartment.
682	I wonder if it's because it reminds you of something else you lost
683	because  you couldn't commit.
684	No, Lily, you're crying over the crown molding
685	and the real hardwood floors. There's no deeper meaning.
686	Right, Lily? Just quit crying and tell him.
687	The apartment is a metaphor for Marshall.
688	- Stop it! - You don't want to see...
689	- ..what I'm like when I'm angry. - It's my card!
690	Stop! Hold on!
691	If we can't settle this like gentlemen,
692	then no one gets the number.
693	- No! Stop the cab. - Wha...?
694	No, wait. Come on. Marshall!
695	81st and First, please.
696	Ah, she does have cute handwriting.
697	The thing about a hangover
698	is that everyone has their own special remedy.
699	Morning, guys. What can I get you?
700	Shh!
701	Bring me the dirtiest, greasiest tuna melt you got.
702	And a milkshake.
703	For you, sir?
704	Gravy.
705	You want that gravy on something?
706	Surprise me.
707	I'd take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn't sitting right here.
708	Just  kidding. I'm good.
709	What are you so chirpy about?
710	She's still drunk from last night.
711	I don't think so.
712	Whoo!
713	Look, if you want Marshall back so bad,
714	how come it took you two days to even ask about him?
715	I was dying to ask. I was just trying to play it cool.
716	But really...
717	But it's good, I mean, work is great...
718	Come on, say something about Marshall. Where's Marshall?
719	How's Marshall? What's Marshall doing right now?
720	Shut up and talk about Marshall. Shut up and talk about Marshall.
721	Shut up and talk about Marshall. Marshall, Marshall,
722	Marshall, Marshall... I've got to ask!
723	And hey, how's Marshall?
724	It was such an awful summer.
725	I just wanted to get back here and see him.
726	But I thought your summer was great.
727	Not exactly.
728	Oh, my God.
729	This is you best work?
730	In all my years teaching, I've never seen anything so needless.
731	To say this is... art...
732	I can't teach you anything.
733	So all those interesting people you met on the bus?
734	Yeah, um...
735	Hi. I'm Mike.
736	I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure travel writer.
737	I'm Paula. I sing in a punk band for children.
738	Hey,  I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon. You are stunning, by the way.
739	I never got in touch because I was too embarrassed.
740	I screwed everything up.
741	I have no job, no place to live.
742	I lost the love of my life.
743	I know I have no right to ask this, but...
744	do you think Marshall would take me back?
745	In a heartbeat.
746	If you called him up, yeah, he'd take you back with open arms.
747	Wow. So maybe  I should call him.
748	Maybe.
749	No! This is... Ow!
750	Hold on.
751	Look, if you're going to go back to him,
752	I don't want to hear the word "maybe."
753	"Maybe" cannot be in your vocabulary.
754	This breakup almost killed him.
755	And he cannot go through it again.
756	So, unless you're absolutely certain, stay the hell away from him.
757	This guy likes pennies.
758	Hi, Marshall.
759	No, go away. I don't want to talk to you.
760	Okay, I know what I did a couple nights back is in a moral gray area.
761	But the great news is, she loved you.
762	If things had gone your way-- you'd gone out a couple times,
763	I think she definitely would have had sex with you.
764	There's no "would" in sex.
765	You're right, I totally... I'm just no good at this, Barney.
766	I'm good at being in a couple, I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend.
767	Being single-- forget it.
768	Come on, you can't give up now.
769	What if I told you that you could relive that night
770	with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes
771	only this time, you get her and I don't.
772	That's not possible.
773	Oh, but it is.
774	She has...
775	wait for it...
776	here it comes...
777	almost there...
778	an identical twin.
779	Yes!
780	A twin isn't the same person.
781	Of course it is. What do you think identical means?
782	"Ident"-- same, "ical"-- person.  Same person.
783	Hey, we could double date.
784	Fine.
785	But you have to promise me, you're not going to steal my new twin,
786	and leave me with your old, used-up twin.
787	Used-up?
788	They're a human being,  Marshall.
789	So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out
790	on a double date with the twins.
791	How you doing?
792	Great. Amazing. This is so much fun.
793	And I think me and the girl are really clicking.
794	You are, you definitely are.
795	Listen, you're going to have to leave now.
796	I just talked with the twins, and get this,
797	I'm going home with both of them.
798	Yeah. That's happening.
799	It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.
800	But they're twins.
801	You-- you said to me that being single
802	would be like being in a candy store.
803	Well, it's not, it's not like a candy store.
804	It's a lawless, postapocalyptic wasteland.
805	- I may be your best friend... - Actually Ted's my best friend.
806	But in this world, it's every hombre for himself.
807	That's what being single is.
808	And after nine years in captivity,
809	that is the single greatest lesson  I can teach you 
810	about surviving in the wild.
811	Now, if you'll excuse me...
812	I have two unique breasts
813	and two duplicates waiting for me.
814	Oh, bad news-- Marshall got food poisoning.
815	- What? - Oh, no.
816	That's too bad. I really liked him.
817	Yeah. Well, I guess  we're just a threesome tonight.
818	Lily, what are you doing here?
819	Oh, I was just walking by. I wasn't...
820	Oh, you mean New York? My program ended.
821	It was just great. Just lots of fun...
822	It was awful. It was the worst mistake I ever made.
823	I'm so sorry, Marshall, and... hello.
824	Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.
825	I know. It was the worst summer of my life.
826	It was the hardest thing that I've ever had to go through.
827	Can we please get back together?
828	All that crap you said to me about,
829	"we need to figure out who we are outside of us,
830	and we need to learn to do things on our own,"
831	it broke my heart.
832	Three months ago, you broke my heart.
833	Can we please get back together?
834	Lily, you were right.
835	All that crap was right.
836	So, no.
837	No, we can't get back together.
838	We shouldn't.
839	At least, not right now.
840	Wow.
841	Okay.
842	Yeah.
843	Well...
844	Will we still see each other?
845	Yeah, yeah.
846	I think so.
847	I don't know.
848	This is all really new to me.
849	I just got out of a long relationship.
850	I like your hair.
851	Thanks.
852	I figured new city, a different color...
853	# ...Wide open road #
854	# It was love to us #
855	# It was all that we had... #
856	And the pizza there, worst pizza ever.
857	I'm so glad to be back in New York.
858	Listen, if there's anything I can do to even begin
859	to make things up to you...
860	Actually there may be something that you can do for me,
861	but you can never ever ask me why.
862	So then I was promoted to assistant ménage-er...
863	Manager-- why do I keep doing that?
864	- Lily? - You gave me chlamydia, you jerk.
865	So where was I? Ah, yes, assistant ménage-er...
866	I did it again. I can't believe it.
867	You gave my twin sister chlamydia. You slime!
868	Wha... wait, I know magic.
869	Well played, Eriksen.
870	Well played.
871	It was taken back in 2006, when Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me
872	and we all went out to brunch.
873	We all look pretty happy, right?
874	Wrong.
875	I wish your face would melt off.
876	I wish your eyeballs would explode.
877	- I hate you. - I hate you more.
878	- I'm going to kill him. - I can't say I blame you.
879	No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.
880	I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.
881	- Not now. - Okay, if you don't, I will.
882	Robin...
883	Okay, for any of this to make sense, you got to understand,
884	there are three parts to this story.
885	Let's start with the Marshall and Lily part.
886	As a 30th anniversary gift, I had flown my parents to New York for the weekend.
887	Oh, I forgot to tell you, your cousin Jimmy
888	had a wonderful time at that spa he visited.
889	You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit cocaine?
890	Coffee?
891	Now, Grandma and Grandpa didn't like to talk about things
892	that were uncomfortable, emotional,
893	or in any way... real.
894	Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.
895	Oh, Lily! Hi, Marshall.
896	Good to see you.
897	I was just stopping by to pick up some of my things.
898	Yes, we were so sorry to hear about your...
899	you know, the, the...
900	Well...
901	Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?
902	Me begging Marshall to take me back and him rejecting me?
903	I love your hair.
904	This was only the second time Marshall and Lily
905	had seen each other since breaking up,
906	but to their credit, it wasn't that awkward.
907	Actually, we're cool.
908	We just divided up CDs. It was all very civil.
909	I'm proud of us; we're, we're good.
910	Well, we were all going to go to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00.
911	Lily, would you like to join us?
912	Um...
913	What?
914	Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable.
915	Why would it?
916	Well, I mean, yeah, we're... we're good,
917	but you got to admit there's that stuff between us.
918	Um, not for me.
919	Now it's just like we're friends.
920	It's like we're brother and sister.
921	"Brother and sister"?!
922	Okay. Fine, yeah, I'll see you at the restaurant, bro.
923	See? Not awkward at all.
924	- Hello, everyone. - Hi.
925	Hello, Marshall.
926	Lily, that is a stunning dress.
927	Oh, thanks.
928	It's kind of revealing, but I thought,
929	"Hey, we're all family." Right, bro?
930	What's wrong?
931	Oh, I, I hurt my ankle in yoga today.
932	The instructor told me to just take deep breaths
933	to get through the pain, just...
934	Are you all right? You're kind of sweating.
935	No, I'm fine. It's just...
936	this roll is really spicy.
937	Lily is evil!
938	She just wore that dress to torture me.
939	Well, you know what? Two can play at that game.
940	See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back.
941	Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too.
942	Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch.
943	No, not that.
944	I'm going to unleash my calves.
945	That's crazy.
946	Nobody's turned on by men's calves.
947	They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.
948	Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs.
949	I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.
950	So Marshall showed up at brunch with a plan.
951	- Hello. - Oh, hi.
952	- Hey, Marshall. - Hey.
953	Hey. How are you feeling?
954	You looked kind of feverish last night.
955	Oh, no, I actually feel great.
956	It is kind of warm in here, though, isn't it?
957	Oh, I don't know, if anything, it's kind of...
958	What are you doing?
959	Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.
960	I'm just making myself feel a little bit more... comfortable.
961	Oh.
962	Oh, yes.
963	I've been doing all these toe lifts lately, and so...
964	my calves have really been cramping up.
965	Take off your dress.
966	Take  off the rest of your pants.
967	I really wasn't expecting that to happen.
968	Yeah, me neither. It kind of complicates things, doesn't it?
969	Yeah, it does. Why did you have to throw your magnificent calves at me?
970	You know you have a punter's leg.
971	Well, why did you have to throw your beautiful boobs at me?
972	You know you have... boobs.
973	Just admit it, you came here trying to seduce me.
974	Seduce you? You seduced me.
975	You sat down next to me and took most of your pants off.
976	You went to San Francisco for three months.
977	How is that seducing you?
978	Well, it's not but I'm still mad about it.
979	All right, that's it-- I want The Beatles Anthology.
980	Oh, well, that's too bad; I'm keeping it.
981	And you know the U2 box set I gave you?
982	Look inside-- all Dave Matthews.
983	You are evil.
984	S mile.
985	I'm going to kill him.
986	I can't say I blame you.
987	No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.
988	Now let's talk about the Barney part of the story.
989	This was going to be Robin's first time meeting my parents,
990	so we were both a little nervous.
991	Barney, what are you doing here?
992	Uh... I'm here to meet your parents.
993	They must be dying to meet me after all
994	the legendary Barney stories you've told them.
995	I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.
996	What?
997	Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about: baseball.
998	But I'm your best friend.
999	Well, actually Marshall's my...
1000	I'm the most important person in your life.
1001	Well, Robin's actually...
1002	How could your parents not know about me?
1003	I'm delightful.
1004	To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses.
1005	I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend
1006	parents want their kid to have.
1007	Oh, really?
1008	Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing
1009	you're most wrong about today.
1010	-  Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. - Ted.
1011	I know you've all been excited to meet...
1012	Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you.
1013	That needlepoint "Bless This Mess" pillow you made for Ted--
1014	what a stitch.
1015	Stitch! Did that just happen?
1016	Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Robin.
1017	- Hello. - Hello.
1018	Oh, it's wonderful to meet you, Robin.
1019	Oh, you are so pretty. Isn't she pretty, Al?
1020	A real looker.
1021	That's funny, I didn't even "look" in the mirror today.
1022	That's not anything, is it?
1023	So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8:00.
1024	San Marino.
1025	Oh, you're serious? Yikes.
1026	No. We have to try Casa A Pezzi.
1027	Best salmon risotto I have ever had.
1028	I love salmon risotto.
1029	I know.
1030	How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi?
1031	They're booked for weeks.
1032	Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress,
1033	which is ironic because...
1034	Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food.
1035	Where do you volunteer, Robin?
1036	What's the matter with you?
1037	I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard.
1038	Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass.
1039	Robin, I'm his best friend.
1040	That's a commitment.
1041	Girlfriend, that's like a bad flu.
1042	Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed.
1043	High five.
1044	Can I help?
1045	Yes, you can, Virginia.
1046	There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it.
1047	Well, funny you should ask.
1048	Whoa! Bravo, Barney.
1049	That is my all-time favorite sonata.
1050	Barney, you are just delightful.
1051	No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted.
1052	And he's just Ted.
1053	I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening.
1054	Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here.
1055	Ow, it's so cold.
1056	All right, that's it, I'm out of here.
1057	In a minute.
1058	Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?
1059	- No, I'm kind of tired. - Me, too.
1060	Yeah, I'm sure my folks are gonna want...
1061	I feel like I could knock back a few cervezas.
1062	Cervezas?
1063	Did he fall?
1064	I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow.
1065	St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m., it's my favorite service.
1066	Wait a minute-- you're able to cross the threshold of a church?
1067	I'll save you a seat.
1068	Oh, you are just terrific.
1069	Isn't he, Susan?
1070	Robin.
1071	Susan, her name is Virginia.
1072	Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now.
1073	Why?
1074	Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?
1075	So Barney darts back into the burning house,
1076	lifts up the refrigerator I'm pinned under
1077	and pulls me to safety.
1078	Whoa. You're like a hero.
1079	Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy.
1080	You know who is a hero?
1081	My Dalmatian, Smokey.
1082	He... didn't... make it out.
1083	I'm sorry.
1084	You poor, brave man.
1085	Why don't you give the guy a hug?
1086	I'm... oh.
1087	My dad was your wingman?
1088	This is really messing with my head.
1089	Barney, is my dad cool?
1090	I'm not done.
1091	So, your dad stays to finish his drink,
1092	but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom.
1093	Sure.
1094	Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back...
1095	Oh, my God...
1096	Oh, my God.
1097	Is that really...
1098	- Oh, my God! - I know.
1099	Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?
1100	My dad made out with Wendy the waitress?
1101	He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible.
1102	Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people
1103	married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side.
1104	Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use "83%"?
1105	You think I'm lying.
1106	Well, have you done any surveys on the subject?
1107	Because the good people at www.swingers.open-marriage-is natural\
1108	legalize-polygamy.org have, and they beg to differ.
1109	That's not a real Web site.
1110	Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K.
1111	- Hi, Dad. - Hey, Ted. Barney.
1112	- Enjoying your vacation so far? - Oh, yeah.
1113	Uh, listen, can I speak to you outside for a sec?
1114	Sure.
1115	So you went out with Barney last night?
1116	Yeah.
1117	You have a good time?
1118	Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry you couldn't join us.
1119	Yeah.
1120	So...
1121	What?
1122	Well...
1123	Well what?
1124	You think Cerrano's got a shot at the RBI title?
1125	I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't.
1126	I guess I got the let's-not-talk- about-anything-uncomfortable gene
1127	Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure.
1128	Smile.
1129	Great.
1130	I  don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.
1131	Not now.
1132	Okay, if you don't, I will.
1133	Robin...!
1134	Okay, now I got to back up all the way to the beginning
1135	to tell you the me and Robin part of the story.
1136	We were expecting my parents at any minute.
1137	One last thing about my mom.
1138	She grills every single one of my girlfriends
1139	about when we're gonna get married and have kids.
1140	But this is the first time she's meeting me.
1141	Doesn't matter.
1142	And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy--
1143	six kids in five years.
1144	The woman's basically a ride at a water park.
1145	But I don't want to get married and have kids.
1146	What am I supposed to say?
1147	You know what?
1148	You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions.
1149	You shouldn't have to apologize for them.
1150	- I'm gonna lie. - I would.
1151	Thanks again for letting me have the U2 box set.
1152	I know how important it is to you.
1153	I talked to Aunt Caroline the other day.
1154	Stacy's pregnant again.
1155	Oh,  good for her.
1156	- So, dear... - Oh, boy.
1157	Tell us what it's like being a journalist.
1158	I'm just not ready.
1159	Okay. No pressure.
1160	Oh. Uh, I thought you, um...
1161	It's great.
1162	Good.
1163	Focus on your job now, because your career clock is ticking.
1164	There's time for marriage and kids and all that other stuff later.
1165	Ooh, a piano!
1166	You lucked out with my mom last night, huh?
1167	What a relief, right?
1168	Oh, absolutely.
1169	Whew, what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend
1170	your mom doesn't want you to have kids with.
1171	Hooray?
1172	I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl
1173	would pop out attractive children?
1174	'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry,
1175	that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman.
1176	Come on, she was just frowning under direct light.
1177	And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her...
1178	It's not important.
1179	What happened to Marshall and Lily?
1180	They've been fighting lately.
1181	They're probably off somewhere going at it.
1182	More coffee?
1183	Oh, no, thank you.
1184	Isn't she sweet?
1185	Well,  if she's so sweet, maybe she should have Ted's babies.
1186	Excuse me?
1187	Nothing.
1188	Just a minute.
1189	Maybe less.
1190	Robin, dear. Did I say something to upset you?
1191	Why don't you want me to have your grandkids?
1192	Do you want to have my grandkids?
1193	No! I mean, I don't know.
1194	I just... I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids.
1195	And you should. I'm a genetic gold mine.
1196	No family history of diabetes or heart disease.
1197	Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight.
1198	I had one schizophrenic uncle, but even he had perfect vision.
1199	Which was unfortunate
1200	for the people around the bell tower he was in,
1201	but still he was a very fine man, and...
1202	Excuse me. Sorry. Didn't know that there was a line.
1203	Marshall, your zipper.
1204	Robin, it's not that I don't want grandkids.
1205	It's just I don't think anyone should make the mistake
1206	of getting married too young.
1207	Why do you say that?
1208	I mean, you got married pretty young. That wasn't a mistake.
1209	Was it?
1210	Well...
1211	Okay, there's something you don't know.
1212	Smile.
1213	I wish your face would melt off.
1214	I wish your eyeballs would explode.
1215	I'm gonna kill him.
1216	I don't care how unpleasant it is, you have to talk to him.
1217	- Not now. - Okay, if you don't, I will.
1218	Robin...!
1219	Oh, gosh, let me help you pick those up, sweetheart.
1220	Sweetheart? Sweetheart?!
1221	The only sweetheart in your life should be the woman
1222	you married 30 years ago, not the waitress at the bar last night
1223	and not this clumsy floozy!
1224	I'm sorry, you're not a floozy.
1225	I'm upset, I don't know what I'm saying.
1226	But stay away from my dad.
1227	Ted, what are you talking about?
1228	Dad?
1229	You, uh, want to tell Mom what happened at the bar last night?
1230	Okay.
1231	I hooked up with a waitress.
1232	Oh.
1233	Oh?
1234	I mean, oh!
1235	Oh! Ooh!
1236	We're going to have a serious talk about this when we get home, Al.
1237	Oh, ooh!
1238	Serious talk? Mom, what...?
1239	He was kissing another woman. Don't you care?
1240	Mrs. Mosby?
1241	Ted, we weren't quite sure how to tell you this...
1242	Your mother and I are divorced.
1243	What do you mean you're divorced? Since when?
1244	Oh, gosh, it's been about nine months now.
1245	Closer to ten, I think.
1246	Time flies.
1247	So ten months ago, you just up and decided
1248	to get divorced without telling me?
1249	No, it wasn't a snap decision.
1250	We'd been separated almost two years.
1251	How could you not tell me this?!
1252	We meant to, it just never seemed like the right time.
1253	So last Christmas...?
1254	We talked about telling you kids then,
1255	but it didn't seem very Christmasy.
1256	I got you a tandem bike.
1257	Oh, it didn't go to waste. Your mother and Frank ride it all the time.
1258	Who the hell is Frank?!
1259	Oh, great guy. I actually set them up.
1260	You remember Dr. Muchnik. He did your braces.
1261	Okay, my head's about to explode,
1262	and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles,
1263	so I am leaving.
1264	Teddy bear, oh...
1265	You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night.
1266	I totally spaced on that.
1267	Ooh, no line at the omelet station.
1268	Lily...
1269	I'm sorry that I said all those things.
1270	Me, too.
1271	I just find it really confusing to be around you right now.
1272	It's the same for me.
1273	I think we're probably both better off trying
1274	to keep some distance for a while.
1275	Yeah, I think you're right.
1276	Are you wearing a push-up bra?
1277	Did you Mystic Tan your calves?
1278	I withdraw the question.
1279	We're sorry we didn't say anything about the divorce.
1280	It was wrong not to tell you.
1281	Thank you.
1282	But listen, don't tell your sister.
1283	It would just upset her.
1284	No, this is ridiculous!
1285	We have to start talking about stuff, and not just baseball.
1286	Indians won today on a walk-off double.
1287	Against the Red Sox? Boy, that's a big win.
1288	No. No. No. We're not gonna blow past this.
1289	I mean, I don't even know who you people.
1290	I don't even know how you met.
1291	I never told you how I met your mother?
1292	- No. - Oh, great story.
1293	At a bar.
1294	That's it?
1295	That's what passes for communication in our family?
1296	Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother,
1297	I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story.
1298	I think it was an Irish bar.
1299	I just, I don't... I don't understand.
1300	You seemed so happy.
1301	When I was growing up, you seemed so...
1302	What happened?
1303	We just realized we're very different people.
1304	Your father's kind of a head-in-the-clouds romantic,
1305	and I'm much more down to earth.
1306	So?
1307	Robin and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything.
1308	I wanted kids. And your mother...
1309	also wanted kids.
1310	Robin and I have different views on families.
1311	We're not about to break up because of it.
1312	On some level, I always knew.
1313	I didn't even want to go out with him in the beginning.
1314	But he spent months badgering me until I finally gave in.
1315	Well, when you don't connect on that many fundamental levels,
1316	it's only a matter of time before you realize you're not meant to be together.
1317	But we love Robin.
1318	Absolutely.
1319	Meeting you was the highlight of my trip.
1320	Well, second highlight.
1321	- We'll see you inside. - Sorry.
1322	Wow.
1323	I know.
1324	They love me!
1325	So we are definitely going to try and communicate more.
1326	From now on, full disclosure.
1327	Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family.
1328	By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls.
1329	I'm gonna get some juice.
1330	No.
1331	No.
1332	You missed a great game last night. Real squeaker.
1333	Kids, sometimes your relationship  goes so smoothly for so long
1334	that you think it will be  that way forever.
1335	It never is.
1336	Well, we just had our first fight.
1337	We had our first fight.
1338	Oh, no, what'd you fight about?
1339	Oh, no, what'd you fight about?
1340	A few months ago,  my architecture firm was approached
1341	to design this new building...
1342	It's this big skyscraper  in Spokane.
1343	It'd be a huge project  for his firm.
1344	And if we don't get it,  we could go under.
1345	So anyway, the head architect  unveils his new design
1346	to the whole company.
1347	- No. - No.
1348	Yes.
1349	All skyscrapers  kind of look like a...
1350	Marshall,  it's a 78-story pink marble tower
1351	with a rounded top
1352	and two spherical  entryways at the front.
1353	Wow, so it's the whole package.
1354	- Yeah, you did. - Had to.
1355	Oh, dude, if they're selling condos,  you got to get me in.
1356	And don't give me the shaft.
1357	- Yeah, you did. - Had to.
1358	It's a travesty.
1359	It's gonna define  the skyline of the city.
1360	If it was me, I could've  designed something amazing.
1361	Instead, I'm spending 12 hours  a day designing the cornices.
1362	- Yeah, you did. - That wasn't one.
1363	So you and Ted  had your first fight.
1364	It obviously ended well.  I mean, you're here with me.
1365	Actually,  it didn't end at all.
1366	I started getting bummed out,  so I came here.
1367	It's what I do.
1368	When my grandma died,  I got a perm.
1369	Ooh, two tragedies in one day.
1370	The thing is,  Ted has been literally
1371	complaining about work  nonstop for weeks.
1372	So, when I came over today,  I was kind of done.
1373	- Hey. - Hey.
1374	- How was your day? - Good.
1375	Wow, you're a great interviewer.
1376	Aren't you gonna ask  how my day was?
1377	No, I know how it was.  It was awful.
1378	Ooh, you want to rent  a movie tonight?
1379	You know, um...
1380	I listen to your work  stories all the time.
1381	Yeah, but...  and I don't want to be rude here,
1382	but my work stories  are interesting.
1383	I'm a television news reporter.
1384	- Robin... - What?
1385	I knew exactly  what he was going to say.
1386	I was just helping him  get there faster.
1387	You should work  at a suicide hotline.
1388	And then it got ugly.
1389	What I don't do is tell you  the same story over and over again.
1390	I mean, you wouldn't  watch the same movie
1391	over and over again, would you?
1392	Maybe a great movie  like Die Hard.
1393	But Field of Dreams?
1394	Once is more than enough.
1395	So that's your go-to bad movie?
1396	The number one example  on the tip of your tongue
1397	of a bad movie is  Field of Dreams?
1398	It's about  ghost baseball players.
1399	I think it's stupid.
1400	So, now he's all mad at me  about the stupid movie.
1401	Robin, he's upset because  you wouldn't listen to him,
1402	not because you didn't like  some movie.
1403	How do you not like  Field of Dreams?!
1404	Listening is the foundation  of a relationship.
1405	And if he's really droning on,
1406	you can always practice  saying the alphabet backwards.
1407	You know, in case  you get pulled over for a DUI.
1408	I guess I don't know  how to do that.
1409	Yeah, it's really hard,  even when you're sober.
1410	That's what I tried  to explain to the cop.
1411	No, I mean, I guess I don't know  how to do this girlfriend thing.
1412	I've  never been in a relationship  this serious before.
1413	I should probably go tell him  I'm sorry, shouldn't I?
1414	You're trying to do it right now,  aren't you?
1415	What the hell comes before "Q"?
1416	Then at the end of the movie when  he has a catch with his dad, like...
1417	like he never did when he was  young enough for it to matter.
1418	Can we talk about something else?
1419	You know what, dude?
1420	Forget about Robin, okay?  You're hanging with us tonight.
1421	I've got an awome party lined up.
1422	Oh, God.
1423	This gonna be another one  of your weird all-guy parties?
1424	That was a poker game.  What is wrong with you?
1425	No, it's the first law school  party of the year
1426	and it's gonna be awesome.
1427	I haven't seen this guys since,  like, last year
1428	before Lily and I broke up.
1429	So I'm gonna have  to break the news to everybody.
1430	It's really gonna bum them out.
1431	This party's gonna suck.
1432	Well, love to join you at that one.
1433	But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.
1434	I wish I could join you guys,  but I got to get back
1435	to my apparently boring job.
1436	- Your job's not boring. - Robin thinks so.
1437	Dude, lots of chicks  think architects are hot.
1438	Think about it,  you create something out of nothing.
1439	You're like God.
1440	There's nobody hotter than God.
1441	I love it when you quote Scripture.
1442	I'm telling you, you should use  the architect angle with the ladies.
1443	Okay, first of all,  I have a girlfriend.
1444	Second, the architect angle  doesn't even work on her.
1445	And, third, I can't imagine  that working on anyone ever.
1446	That's 'cause you're always like...
1447	Ted Mosby, architect.
1448	If it were me, I'd be like...
1449	Ted Mosby, architect.
1450	Anything sounds impressive when  it's said with the right attitude.
1451	Marshall Ericksen.
1452	Recently dumped  and heading to a lame party.
1453	Whoa. Whoa, ladies,  please take it easy.
1454	There's enough of me for everyone.
1455	Oh. Hi. Hello.
1456	All right. We're gonna take off..
1457	Wait up, I'll leave with you guys.
1458	Ted Mosby, architect.
1459	Trust me.
1460	Hey, just out of curiosity.
1461	If a guy told you  he was an architect,
1462	what  would you think of that?
1463	Are you kidding?
1464	Architects are hot.
1465	How do you think Mr. Brady  scored a babe like Carol?
1466	Solid point.
1467	She did have hair of gold.
1468	- Yes, she did. - Mm-hmm.
1469	Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?
1470	No.
1471	Hey, Lily.
1472	- You still single? - Yes.
1473	You know... I've poured a lot of  free drinks for you over the years.
1474	A lot.
1475	Carl, do you really want  to be with a woman
1476	who would trade sex for beer?
1477	Only if you're into it.
1478	It's on me.
1479	Thanks.
1480	I wonder where Ted went.
1481	Ted Mosby, the architect?
1482	Actually, yeah.
1483	Oh, he is such a cool guy.
1484	He was here earlier.
1485	And what made you decide  you wanted to become an architect?
1486	Well, you know, soul of an artist,
1487	hands of a master craftsman.
1488	It was inevitable, I guess.
1489	I bet you can draw, can't you?
1490	You should draw me.
1491	Well, I could try, but you might end up  looking like a midcentury tri-level.
1492	Hey. If you want, my friend Marshall  invited me to this party we could all go to.
1493	Marshall's great.  He's just a lawyer,
1494	but somebody has to push the paper  around for us creative types.
1495	- Am I right? - Yeah.
1496	He asked her to a party.  Oh, my God, are you okay?
1497	Okay? It's awesome.  It's a win-win.
1498	Ted got to vent  and I don't have to hear it.
1499	Maybe after he's done with  the talkie-talk, he'll come over
1500	and I'll get the fun part.
1501	What is wrong with you?
1502	God, I feel like I'm teaching  love as a second language here.
1503	Okay, you know how when  he tells you boring work stories
1504	you're supposed to listen?
1505	Well, when he picks up  some random girl at a bar,
1506	you're supposed to freak out.
1507	I'm not freaking out  because in my mind, she's fat.
1508	She's a kickboxing instructor.
1509	Her ass looks better than my face.
1510	All right, we'll swing by the party.
1511	Now the party was for  some of Marshall's classmates
1512	from Columbia Law School,
1513	who by day were some of the sharpest
1514	and  most serious  young legal minds in the country.
1515	By night, however...
1516	Damn, these are some  drunk almost-lawyers.
1517	Okay! Seriously...
1518	who wants to shave my ass?!
1519	That guy went on to become  a Supreme Court justice.
1520	Okay, where are  the guys and the hooker?
1521	Yo, what's up, ladies?  Welcome to the party. Yeah!
1522	Just need you to sign  this release protecting the host
1523	from any and all responsibility  should you harm yourself
1524	or a third party.
1525	Then freakin' rage! Yeah!
1526	Hey, drunk legal dude, um...  have you seen Marshall Ericksen?
1527	He was with a guy named Ted.
1528	You mean Ted Mosby, the architect?
1529	Man, what a visionary.
1530	Yeah, they were here.
1531	Awards are nice,  they look good on my shelf.
1532	But none of that acclaim means  anything compared to the joy
1533	of seeing the sun rise over  your first building.
1534	Wow.
1535	I would love to watch  the sun rise with you.
1536	I know you would.
1537	It's the job.
1538	Dude. You should let us  shave your ass tonight.
1539	No way.
1540	Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?
1541	I didn't want to ruin the party  for everybody this early, but, uh...
1542	everyone take a seat.
1543	Um... Lily actually called off  the wedding this summer
1544	to go to San Francisco.
1545	So...
1546	we're broken up.
1547	Her name wasn't on  your lease, was it?
1548	'Cause if not, New York state law,  you're not obligated
1549	to give her half the deposit  when you move.
1550	Yeah,  that's not really the part  I was worried about, guys.
1551	And don't forget the precedent set  by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74.
1552	Any personal effects she left  in your house or dwelling
1553	become yours after 30 days.
1554	Guys, can we cease and desist  with the lawyer speak for a minute?
1555	Love died.
1556	The love that made you all believe  in love, that's dead now.
1557	You should sue her.
1558	Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?
1559	On the grounds of... shut up.
1560	That's our attorney general.
1561	See? Marshall's still hung up  on our breakup.
1562	Why? Because I listened to him.
1563	It was a strong  and nurturing relationship
1564	that I threw away like old gum.
1565	Not that I'm worried or anything,  but, um, back to the sun rising
1566	over Ted and, uh... oh,  what tasteful way did you describe her?
1567	The girl with the smackable ass.
1568	Yes,  that's the young lady.
1569	So, I know the bouncer  at this techno club, Posers.
1570	Do you feel like dancing?
1571	Yeah, okay.  There is no way Ted went dancing.
1572	Ted hates clubs.
1573	Hell, yeah. I love clubs.
1574	I mean, I was going to design  a cathedral tonight,
1575	kind of take a whack at the whole  relationship between God and man conundrum.
1576	But sure, let's go dancing.
1577	Wait, let me just check  with my friend.
1578	Okay.
1579	Hey, Marshall. You up for  some super loud, repetitive music
1580	that hasn't changed  since the mid-90s?
1581	Um... only always.
1582	Let's go.
1583	Dancing?  He went dancing with this girl?
1584	Okay, maybe this is a little bad.
1585	Dancing is bad.  Dancing leads to sex.
1586	Did you grow up  in that Footloose town?
1587	I'm calling him.  I'm telling him that I was wrong
1588	and I'm sorry, and I totally want to  listen to his stupid stories.
1589	Yeah, think of another way  to phrase that and you'll be fine.
1590	He's not answering.
1591	Calling Marshall.
1592	Hello.
1593	Marshall, hi, it's Robin.  Can I talk to Ted?
1594	Oh, Robin, hi.
1595	Um, no, Ted's not here tonight.  He's, uh... he's working.
1596	Uh, okay. Bye.
1597	Marshall just lied.
1598	Ted's cheating on me.
1599	Excuse me. I'm looking for  a couple guys who came in here earlier.
1600	One's about six-four, 210,  sandy brown hair.
1601	And the other's a cheating bastard.
1602	You're going to need  to refresh my memory.
1603	Okay, fella, baby knows  how this game's played.
1604	How's a $20 help your memory?
1605	Thanks, but seriously,  it was crazy tonight.
1606	You really do need  to refresh my memory.
1607	Then can I have the...?
1608	That's cool. You keep that.
1609	So these guys--  one of them's an architect.
1610	Ted Mosby, the architect?
1611	That's the one.
1612	Oh, yeah, he was here.
1613	And then I was all, "No, Frank Gehry.  You're on your own this time."
1614	And that, my dear,  was the end of that hack's career.
1615	I live across the street.
1616	That is one hell of a non sequitur.
1617	You want to come over?
1618	Well, I don't know.
1619	But I suppose I should at least  give you a ride home.
1620	Hop on.
1621	I'll see you at book club, Vinny.
1622	- Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudités. - Nice.
1623	Dude, dude, what are you doing?
1624	Galloping.
1625	You proved it, all right? The whole  Ted Mosby, architect things works.
1626	Architects rule! Whoo-hee!
1627	Aren't you a little worried  that a certain somebody
1628	might find out that  you're doing this?
1629	This isn't you, Ted.
1630	It is tonight.
1631	Whoo!
1632	You know this girl.  Where does she live?
1633	I'm not telling you that  for less than 20 bucks.
1634	- Well, I'm out of money. - I'm cashed, too.
1635	I'll take your purse.
1636	My purse?
1637	Yeah, my girl likes clutches.
1638	Okay, fine.
1639	You should tell her that looks  really good with a chocolate boot.
1640	Bitch is lucky I brought  my small purse.
1641	No room for my gun. Here.
1642	Now where does the rodeo slut live?
1643	The building with the green light,  apartment 3-C.
1644	Oh, my God, Robin,
1645	are you going to kick  this girl's ass?
1646	Yeah...
1647	and steal her purse.
1648	I can't believe  he's cheating on me.
1649	You know how many times  I could have cheated?
1650	Six... no seven.
1651	And you know two of them,  and they would surprise you.
1652	3-C, let's do this. You ready?
1653	Should I just kick the door in?
1654	Those are really nice heels  and you already lost the purse.
1655	Let's see if it's unlocked.
1656	It's unlocked.
1657	Okay, get in there  and kick some spankable ass.
1658	Robin.
1659	- I'm the problem. - What?
1660	You were right.
1661	I don't know how to be a girlfriend.
1662	I took the nicest guy in the world
1663	and I made him a cheater.
1664	Well, don't stand out here  and beat yourself up.
1665	Get in there and beat Ted up.
1666	I'll handle the slutty kickboxer.
1667	Actually, I'll take Ted.
1668	- Let's do this. - Bring it.
1669	What do you think you're...?
1670	Barney?
1671	Thank God you're here.  Can you help with this? I need nails.
1672	Okay, I'm totally lost here.  Where's Ted?
1673	Ted? He's at work.
1674	How did you get here?
1675	Awesome story. As per usual.
1676	How do you think Mr. Brady  scored a babe like Carol?
1677	Solid point.
1678	- And she did have hair of gold. - Yes, she did.
1679	Sorry, I forgot my binocs  for Foxy Boxing.
1680	Whoo, looks like things just got  a little foxier right here.
1681	Yes, they did.  And you're just in time.
1682	Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you  in very good, if slightly sullied hands.
1683	Don't go. We don't even know your name  to look out for your buildings.
1684	Yeah, stay.
1685	Excuse us for one second.
1686	Okay, you were right--  the architect thing totally works.
1687	But I've got a girlfriend  and I've got to get back to work.
1688	This project is getting  harder and harder.
1689	- Yeah, you did. - Yeah, had to.
1690	See ya.
1691	Sorry, my, uh...  intern had to leave.
1692	Oh, well, that's too bad.
1693	I'm Anna, by the way.
1694	Ted Mosby... architect.
1695	But none of that acclaim means  anything compared to the joy
1696	of  seeing the sun rise  over your first building.
1697	- Dude, dude, what are you doing? - Galloping.
1698	All right, you proved it. The whole  Ted Mosby, architect thing works.
1699	Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.
1700	Aren't you afraid a certain somebody  might find out about this?
1701	I mean, this isn't you, Ted.
1702	It is tonight.
1703	And that led to a couple of hours
1704	that I cannot, as a gentleman,  divulge to you.
1705	We did it right here,  and here and here.
1706	But why would you use  Ted's name?
1707	I've had some recent bad press  on the World Wide Web.
1708	So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole  "using my real name" thing.
1709	Oh, this is great.  It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.
1710	Everything isn't okay.
1711	Look at me. I'm acting crazy  and jealous and paranoid.
1712	This is how people act  in relationships.
1713	And that's why  I avoid relationships.
1714	Well, guess what,
1715	I haven't been crazy or jealous  or paranoid in months,
1716	and I really miss it.
1717	And thus ended this chapter of,  "Let's pour our hearts out
1718	in the bedroom of Barney's  one-night stand."
1719	Come on, let's go before  she gets out of the shower.
1720	You're such a pig.  You're not even going to say good-bye?
1721	I'll have you know  I composed a lovely form letter
1722	for use in just such an occasion.
1723	Just fill out her name and then...
1724	Something with a "A."
1725	A... A...
1726	I'll just put "resident."
1727	Go, go, go, go.
1728	Robin took a long walk that night.
1729	She thought about how opening  yourself up to another person
1730	usually means opening yourself up  to going a little crazy.
1731	She thought about how much easier  it was just to be alone.
1732	And then she came to see me.
1733	# And I am nothing of a builder #
1734	# But here I dreamt I was an architect... # Hey.
1735	Hey.
1736	- What are you doing here? - I brought donuts.
1737	And I don't want to brag,  but they're filled with jelly.
1738	Thanks.
1739	So, uh... how was your night?
1740	It was... fine. Nothing exciting.
1741	How was yours?
1742	You really want to hear about  boring architect stuff?
1743	Yes, I do.
1744	I'm sorry about earlier.
1745	To tell you the truth, I never  even saw all of Field of Dreams.
1746	I fell asleep half way through.
1747	What? The best part's  the last 20 minutes.
1748	Well, maybe they should have moved that  part up a little bit earlier, 'cause...
1749	You know what, um...
1750	What I'm trying to say is...
1751	I love being the person  you bitch to.
1752	So how was your day,  Mr. Architect?
1753	Oh, I like the way  you say that.
1754	Hey, you want to see  the building
1755	that will make every man  in Spokane feel inadequate?
1756	Obviously.
1757	- Wow. - Yeah.
1758	You know, you didn't mention  all the foliage around the base.
1759	If you trim that back,  the rest would look bigger.
1760	You don't have to tell me.
1761	And, um... just for fun, I've...
1762	I've sort of been working on my own idea  of what I think the building should be.
1763	What do you think?
1764	You know that time we went to Spokane  and I pointed out that skyscraper?
1765	That was the first building  I ever designed.
1766	And that night was the first time  I showed anyone my first drawing of it.
1767	Wow.
1768	Ted, this is amazing.
1769	Thanks.
1770	It's not like it will ever  come to anything.
1771	I don't know.
1772	It might come to something.
1773	You know, girls find  architects very hot.
1774	Okay,
1775	but I don't want you expecting  78 stories or anything.
1776	"Dear Resident...
1777	The time we spent together,  however long it was,
1778	meant the world to me.
1779	I would love to see you again,  but unfortunately, I cannot.
1780	You see, I am a ghost.
1781	I can't only materialize  once every decade
1782	on the anniversary of my death.
1783	I chose to spend my one day among  the living with you,
1784	sweet... Resident.
1785	Perhaps we will meet again  in another decade,
1786	provided you keep your figure.
1787	Until then, all my love  from the beyond.
1788	Barney."
1789	Barney?
1790	Who the hell is Barney?
1791	Your Uncle Barney was always always a bit of an enigma.
1792	In all the years we lived in New York,
1793	none of us had ever set foot in his apartment.
1794	Until one day, one of us did.
1795	It's a pretty good story.
1796	And believe it or not, alcohol did not play a role.
1797	It all started two weeks earlier at Lily's housewarming.
1798	Hey, welcome to my new home.
1799	Oh, wow, Lily, this is...
1800	Oh, this is all of it.
1801	Yeah, I know it's small, but it's got character.
1802	Thank you.
1803	And I am learning Lithuanian from my neighbors.
1804	They're great.
1805	They're always out there in the hall, you know,
1806	cooking and gambling and giving each other haircuts.
1807	It's nice.
1808	Hey, is that a toilet in your kitchen?
1809	Or a stove in your bathroom?
1810	Oh, that's not just a stove.
1811	That's a stovenkerator:
1812	a combination of a stove, oven and sink and refrigerator.
1813	Stovenkerator.
1814	Isn't that futuristic?
1815	God, I hope not.
1816	Hey, cool Murphy bed.
1817	Yeah, it's kind of a mess. I didn't make my bed this morning, so...
1818	Oh!
1819	You know what, I bet sleeping at this angle is good for you.
1820	For some reason.
1821	I got it.
1822	That was, something, something, I am going to, something,
1823	you like a, something, donkey.
1824	Huh.
1825	Other cultures.
1826	Hey, let's break out the fruit basket.
1827	Hey, who ate all the...?
1828	Okay, we have to get Lily out of that apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon.
1829	I'd offer her my place, but I've got dogs and she's allergic.
1830	Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think  she's a little more allergic to that.
1831	What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery,
1832	but it's gotta have a couch.
1833	The Fortress of Barnitude? No way.
1834	Come on. She's desperate.
1835	Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home,
1836	but... pass.
1837	One of you guys is very, very lucky because I have...
1838	a boom, an extra ticket to the Alanis Morissette concert. Who's in?
1839	- Absolutely not. - No.
1840	Damn! I got these tickets, like, months ago for me and Lily
1841	and now I can't find anyone to go with me.
1842	This is what I miss about being in a couple.
1843	I always had someone to go to concerts with,
1844	or farmer's market,
1845	or brunch.
1846	God, I miss brunch!
1847	Well, I guess you could-- well, you could try going to brunch alone.
1848	Oh, you don't think I've tried?
1849	Table for one.
1850	One couple?
1851	Um, no, just me.
1852	Really?
1853	For brunch?
1854	You're right. Who am I kidding?
1855	Ooh, The Popover Pantry. That place is great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow?
1856	Of course, sweetie.
1857	Can I go with you guys?
1858	Really? For brunch?
1859	God, I hate being single!
1860	Okay, I'll take the over on the Pittsburgh game.
1861	Oh, and P. to the S., I never got my payout
1862	from Seattle from two weeks ago.
1863	Yeah. Don't make me call the gaming commission on you.
1864	I'm sure they'd be very interested to know what's going on over there.
1865	All right? All right?
1866	Okay, I love you, too, Mom. Take care.
1867	Hello, Lily.
1868	You've somehow managed to circumvent my security.
1869	How did you do it?
1870	Ted gave me your spare key.
1871	Spare key, brilliant!
1872	I'm sorry, but you know I'd only come here
1873	if I had no other choice.
1874	But earlier today, I was getting ready to go to sleep and...
1875	Sveikas.
1876	That's terrible.
1877	Well, see ya.
1878	Well, can I stay here maybe?
1879	Oh... I'd let you, but I don't have any room.
1880	You live in a two-bedroom apartment.
1881	You have one room just for your suits.
1882	Hey, I'm at a point in my life where my suits are my family.
1883	Look around you, Lily.
1884	You  are in the heart of bachelor country,
1885	and as a woman, you are an illegal immigrant here.
1886	Now, you can try to apply for a sex visa, but that only lasts 12 hours.
1887	14 if you qualify for multiple entry.
1888	Eww... is something some lame, judgmental chick would say,
1889	but I say give me multiple high fives.
1890	Wow, you really are desperate.
1891	I really am.
1892	Okay, you can stay here for two days.
1893	But I only have one rule. You can't change anything.
1894	Why would I change anything? This place is...
1895	...perfect.
1896	Except for the fact that you don't have a TV.
1897	See that wall?
1898	300-inch flat-screen.
1899	They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy.
1900	Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong.
1901	It hurts my eyes.
1902	Yeah. That doesn't go away.
1903	- Hey. - Hey, where have you been?
1904	The Alanis Morissette concert.
1905	By yourself?
1906	No,  actually I went with a friend from law school.
1907	Oh, really? Who's this friend?
1908	Brad.
1909	- Bro, Alanis Morissette rocks! - Totally!
1910	I can't believe I almost didn't come tonight.
1911	Let me guess: You bought the tickets for you and Lily
1912	right before she dumped you.
1913	Yeah, how'd you know?
1914	I just got dumped myself.
1915	What, Kara broke up with you?
1916	I'm sorry, man. That sucks.
1917	Brad, do you like brunch?
1918	You invited him to brunch?
1919	Yeah, I invited him to brunch. Why, is that weird?
1920	Yes. That's why I was all, "You invited him to brunch?"
1921	Why can't two guys who are friends go to brunch?
1922	Because brunch is kind of...
1923	Girly.
1924	Girly? Breakfast isn't girly.
1925	Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?
1926	I don't know.
1927	There's nothing girly about a horse.
1928	Nothing girly about a horn,
1929	but put them together and you get a unicorn.
1930	I don't care what either of you say,
1931	I am going to The Popover Pantry with Brad.
1932	We're here. We're hungry.
1933	Get used to it, brunch.
1934	- Hmm... smells delicious. - Thank you.
1935	There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up...
1936	What are you doing?
1937	Lily, what was the first rule again?
1938	Don't change anything.
1939	And what was the second rule?
1940	- There was no second rule. - Exactly!
1941	There was only one rule and you broke it.
1942	I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?
1943	Lily, if I wanted a fridge full of groceries,
1944	or fresh coffee in the morning,
1945	I'd be in a relationship.
1946	But I don't want to be in a relationship.
1947	That's why I make it crystal-clear to every girl that walks through that door
1948	that this is not a place to leave a toothbrush.
1949	This is not a place to leave a contact lens case.
1950	This is a place to leave.
1951	Come on, I'll give you a tour.
1952	Uh, no flash photography, please.
1953	Bienvenido to the bedroom.
1954	Dig this: king-sized bed,
1955	full-sized blanket, one pillow.
1956	Everything about this bed says, "our work here is done."
1957	Next we say "bienvenue" to the bathroom.
1958	What, only one towel?
1959	What, no hairdryer?
1960	You know where I keep that stuff? Your place. Beat it.
1961	And the coup de grace...
1962	Yeah, that's right.
1963	Patent-pending.
1964	And wilkommen to the hallway.
1965	While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their porn...
1966	Marshall doesn't have porn.
1967	Aww, that's sweet.
1968	While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their porn,
1969	I had mine... professionally lit.
1970	Girls see this, they can't  get out of here fast enough.
1971	And if that doesn't drive them away,
1972	there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.
1973	No, that's just awesome.
1974	So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here,
1975	I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else.
1976	My apartment does it for me.
1977	God, I love brunch.
1978	Oh, damn...
1979	the zucchini bread is "ridonculous."
1980	This isn't weird, right?
1981	I sort of thought it might be,
1982	but it totally isn't.
1983	And B-T-dub, you totally did not oversell the eggs Benny.
1984	Right?  Right?
1985	I mean, why can't two single bros go out and rock brunch Sunday morning-style?
1986	Exactly. Thank you, that's exactly what I've been saying.
1987	This must be destiny.
1988	What are you talking about?
1989	I have two tickets for Mamma Mia Friday night.
1990	You like Abba, right?
1991	What am I saying? Who doesn't?
1992	Anyway, I was gonna take Kara, but now it's all you and me.
1993	We're gonna do Broadway, bro style. What do you say?
1994	Yeah!
1995	Hey. Did the cold wake you?
1996	No,  I've just been watching you sleep.
1997	Oh, did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel.
1998	I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day.
1999	O kay.
2000	I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to...
2001	I'm boycotting coffee.
2002	You may as well drink the tears of a Colombian peasant farmer.
2003	God, I love this place.
2004	Good thing I don't have a job
2005	because I could stay here all day.
2006	I think I left something on the bookshelf.
2007	Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look.
2008	Oh, I'm disgusting.
2009	Wow, you're open about your sexuality
2010	and that's one of the reasons I love you.
2011	Did I just say that?
2012	Oh, well, cat's out of the bag.
2013	I love you.
2014	Whoa, uh... Okay, beep, beep. Backing up, um...
2015	Hi, Barney. Oh...
2016	Oh, my God. Are you married? Is this your wife?
2017	What? No.
2018	Yes!
2019	- Yes? - Yes.
2020	You son of a bitch!
2021	I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple.
2022	Come on, baby. Please, no. Oh, you don't understand.
2023	What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...?
2024	You're not going anywhere.
2025	Wow, that was close.
2026	That hippie chick wouldn't leave.
2027	She was ready to squat here.
2028	Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?
2029	She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment...
2030	except you.
2031	You're better than porn.
2032	Thank you.
2033	How would you like to extend your stay here?
2034	All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife,
2035	and scare off the occasional one-night stand.
2036	I know, I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles...
2037	I'll do it.
2038	Really?
2039	Barney, you've clearly got some serious mother issues
2040	that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat.
2041	But, in my other apartment, I would be living
2042	with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win.
2043	I'll take it.
2044	- Mamma Mia? - Mamma Mia.
2045	You know what? It's supposed to be a great musical, okay?
2046	It won all sorts of Tonys and stuff.
2047	No, totally. It sounds like a really, really fun, exciting, third date.
2048	Ooh, third date. You know what that means.
2049	It is not a date, okay.
2050	It's just two bros taking in a Broadway show.
2051	You bros going to get dinner beforehand?
2052	We might grab a steak, yeah.
2053	Where at?
2054	Cafe L'Amour.
2055	Brad says the food is really good there, okay.
2056	Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out.
2057	You better bring your "A" game.
2058	That means no granny panties.
2059	All right, you know what? You two are just threatened
2060	because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' turf.
2061	Well, guess what? It's my territory now.
2062	I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals.
2063	That's right; Brad and I are taking back Broadway.
2064	What are you going to wear?
2065	I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin...
2066	Oh, you know what? Shut up.
2067	Can you pass the Arts and Leisure?
2068	Can you pass the Arts and Leisure?
2069	I just did.
2070	Honey, I'm...
2071	Barney, what the hell is going on here?
2072	Lily, I can explain...
2073	How could you? In our own home?
2074	You bastard!
2075	- I'm so sorry. I didn't know he had... - Just get out.
2076	This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years
2077	to put you through medical school?
2078	I got breast implants for you.
2079	I... I was just about to turn on the tears.
2080	Brava.
2081	That was incredible.
2082	And that slap was genius. You did not hold back.
2083	Yeah, that I just always wanted to do.
2084	Fair enough.
2085	I have to say,
2086	it's kind of nice having food around here for a change.
2087	You know...
2088	nah, never mind.
2089	What?
2090	You're my wife. You can tell me anything.
2091	Well, if you really wanted to sell this ruse,
2092	we should try to make this place a little more...
2093	you know, homey.
2094	Like-like a woman would actually live here.
2095	What did you have in mind?
2096	# Bones, bones, brittle little bones #
2097	# It's not the milk you seek #
2098	# It's the sun you need #
2099	# Sugar dumpling, muffin baby #
2100	# This world is going crazy #
2101	# Do do do do #
2102	# Do do do do #
2103	# Do do do do do #
2104	Hey, you're home.
2105	I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning.
2106	Ha, ha, ha, ha. It wasn't a date.
2107	Okay, it was a date and it got way weird.
2108	Oh, you really don't have to do that.
2109	No, I insist. You're my guest.
2110	Thanks, Brad.
2111	Bro,
2112	you got some chocolate on your chin.
2113	Still there.
2114	I'll get that bad boy.
2115	Whoa.
2116	Well, it could have been worse.
2117	It could have fallen in your lap.
2118	It gets worse.
2119	No, I-I can do it, Brad. Okay, thank you.
2120	So anyway, ah, it's this Saturday.
2121	Do you want to come?
2122	You want me to go to a wedding with you?
2123	Okay, that's not too bad.
2124	Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like Wedding Crashers.
2125	Just keep Brad away from the bouquet.
2126	It gets worse.
2127	It gets better.
2128	The foliage in Vermont this time of year is ridonc.
2129	Vermont?
2130	Yeah, the wedding's at this awesome B&B.
2131	Kara and I used to go there.
2132	Anyway, there is one room left, and we got it.
2133	Walt Whitman Suite, bro.
2134	You said no, right?
2135	Of course.
2136	I understand.
2137	It's cool.
2138	It's the first time I was going to see my college friends
2139	since Kara left me.
2140	I just...
2141	I just miss her so much.
2142	I'll go to Vermont with you.
2143	That's great!
2144	You know, uh, they're registered at Pottery Barn.
2145	I figure we could go halfsies on a gravy boat.
2146	I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore.
2147	Damn you, brunch!
2148	This guy's crazy, right?
2149	Look, I don't think he's crazy.
2150	I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal.
2151	And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch.
2152	And now you have to do what every dysfunctional couple has to do:
2153	break up.
2154	You're right. You're right. I promised Brad
2155	I would go to the wedding with him, and then that is it.
2156	Good man.
2157	Oh, I think we made the right decision
2158	going for the custom-made Italian sheets.
2159	Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right.
2160	Want to give it a whirl?
2161	All right, I'm going to head out, hit the bars.
2162	What are you going to do tonight?
2163	Oh, I was just going to watch Letterman but, God this bed is so comfy.
2164	I wish you had a TV in here.
2165	Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living?
2166	Please.
2167	I thought you were going out.
2168	Eh.
2169	After the monologue.
2170	The next morning, as the sun rose over Manhattan,
2171	your Uncle Marshall headed over to Brad's apartment
2172	to leave for the wedding in Vermont.
2173	But when he got there...
2174	No.
2175	No...
2176	No.
2177	No!
2178	No.
2179	Ted.
2180	Um, Brad got me flowers.
2181	Hold  on.
2182	Brad got him flowers.
2183	I'm sorry. It just got funny again.
2184	- Oh, hey... - No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it.
2185	I do like you. And calla lilies  are my favorite flower.
2186	I don't know how you knew that. I guess you just get me,
2187	but this is not cool, man. I can't believe that you would...
2188	- Hey, sweetie. - Hey.
2189	- Hey, Marshall. - Hi, Kara.
2190	So you guys, are like, back together now?
2191	Yeah. Happened last night.
2192	Uh, I'm sorry, bro.
2193	- I should have called you. - Yeah, you should have.
2194	- Well, I didn't mean to hurt... - Don't, Brad.
2195	Just don't.
2196	# There was something # # in the air that night #
2197	# The stars went bright #
2198	Oh, what was with him?
2199	I don't know.
2200	I think he's in love with me.
2201	# Fernando #
2202	I can't believe we just... you and I...
2203	- what have we done? - Nothing.
2204	Nothing happened. We-we just went to sleep.
2205	Just went to sleep? I don't sleep  in the same bed as a woman
2206	and not make a move.
2207	How could... You.
2208	You spooned me against my will.
2209	Hey, it takes two to cuddle.
2210	We...
2211	We...
2212	We redecorated my place.
2213	We stayed in on a Friday night to watch Letterman,
2214	and then slept together and didn't have sex?
2215	Oh, my God, we're in a relationship.
2216	That's what you think a relationship is?
2217	You were supposed to be the vaccine,
2218	but you gave me the disease. You gotta go.
2219	Barney.
2220	I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself.
2221	You let down your guard, and let someone into your life,
2222	and-and it actually felt okay.
2223	And that terrifies you.
2224	Uh-huh. You gotta go.
2225	Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place,
2226	and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living.
2227	A certain standard of living? You didn't pay a single...
2228	And so Mr. and Mrs. Stinson,  after two weeks of marriage,
2229	decided to call it quits.
2230	Fortunately, they reached a settlement.
2231	And that's the story of how Aunt Lily furnished her apartment.
2232	Marshall ran into Brad again some time later.
2233	Oh, my God, it's Brad.
2234	Laugh like I said something really funny.
2235	Right, right.
2236	Hey, Marshall.
2237	Oh, hey, hey, how's it going?
2238	It's good.
2239	- Hey, I'm, uh... - Yeah, I know who you are.
2240	Well, I got to go. I got this thing.
2241	Yeah, me too, but more important.
2242	So, I guess I'll see you around.
2243	Sure. Sure.
2244	Even if you don't believe it, tell me he looks fat.
2245	Totally looks fat.
2246	Kids, when you reach your late 20s you might be surprised
2247	to discover you still don't have life quite figured out.
2248	Like with Aunt Lily.
2249	Even though she was back from San Francisco,
2250	she was still on a quest to find herself.
2251	It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten.
2252	I want to get out there and change the world.
2253	I want to find my passion.
2254	And she did find it.
2255	I'm going to be a life coach.
2256	In fact, she found it again and again.
2257	I'm going to be a marine biologist.
2258	...slam poet. ...beekeeper!
2259	Not a beekeeper.
2260	Her newest lifelong dream?
2261	Singing in a punk rock band.
2262	What is she doing for money through all this?
2263	Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.
2264	Wait, you mean that Hawaiian place
2265	where they wear those embarrassing outfits?
2266	No.
2267	Here she comes. Here she comes.
2268	Welcome to Big Wave Luau. May I tiki your drink order?
2269	Aw, crap.
2270	I'm sorry.
2271	Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood,
2272	thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here.
2273	What do you want?
2274	Oh, I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet
2275	a customer at Big Wave Luau.
2276	Aloha, island visitors.
2277	The big wave brought you to our humble luau.
2278	For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.
2279	I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?
2280	No.
2281	My name is Anuhea.
2282	It means cool and fragrant,
2283	much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.
2284	Robin, nothing to add?
2285	No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her
2286	for trying to follow her dreams.
2287	Thank you.
2288	Although, you might want to bring out the big Hawaiian drum
2289	because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.
2290	Birthday girl!
2291	I have never needed beer more than I do right now.
2292	I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake.
2293	I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time
2294	and you said, "Dude, my semester is gonna be this."
2295	Yeah, well, it was supposed to be,
2296	but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen.
2297	She had like a bad divorce this summer
2298	and now she's taking it out on us.
2299	To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.
2300	Really?
2301	Laid, you say?
2302	You wouldn't be into her. She's, like, in her late 40s.
2303	She hot?
2304	Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.
2305	And she's looking for some action.
2306	Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.
2307	- A what? - A cougar.
2308	An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s,
2309	single and on the prowl for a younger man.
2310	What's a woman in her 60s or 70s-- a turtle?
2311	Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.
2312	- I didn't challenge you to have sex... - Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.
2313	So, I quit my job.
2314	I just couldn't take it anymore.
2315	Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei...
2316	Classic.
2317	Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?
2318	Yeah.
2319	Somebody did just quit.
2320	So, where should we eat today?
2321	Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone?
2322	Dude, that is cold-blooded.
2323	It was an honest mistake.
2324	Look,  when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it,
2325	it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.
2326	Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.
2327	It was an whole chicken.
2328	And did I mention she had 12 sides?
2329	Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.
2330	So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?
2331	What would I be doing?
2332	Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.
2333	You'll sit there. My station is right over here.
2334	And things are a little bit crazy right now
2335	'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.
2336	- Oh, right, is that the... - Yeah.
2337	Here's the model.
2338	You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant penis.
2339	I know.
2340	For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.
2341	How can he not see it?
2342	- I mean there's the... - I know.
2343	- And the way it... - I know.
2344	- And the two little... - I know.
2345	- Wow, it is just... - Spectacular?
2346	Why, thank you.
2347	Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project.
2348	Lily's going to be our new office assistant.
2349	- Ah. - Nice to meet you.
2350	Isn't it?
2351	Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony.
2352	Tell me, do you want to be an architect?
2353	I, uh... I am an architect.
2354	Really?
2355	Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with Legos.
2356	Is he an architect?
2357	Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.
2358	Ted, you've got promise.
2359	But you have to study what I do more carefully.
2360	Now I want you to design some Styrofoam trees
2361	for the building model.
2362	- Think you can handle that? - Absolutely.
2363	Good. So you're going to design the...
2364	- Styrofoam trees. - Once again-- with feeling.
2365	- Styrofoam trees. - Styrofoam trees!
2366	- Styrofoam trees! - That's the spirit.
2367	Now, gather 'round.
2368	This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life.
2369	And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right
2370	or you're fired, hmm?
2371	Man, that guy is a total, well...
2372	Okay,  wait, wait, wait. That's Professor Lewis's office there.
2373	Okay, let's take a look.
2374	Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right.
2375	A prime specimen.
2376	See,  you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics.
2377	Start with the hair.
2378	The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles
2379	as a form of camouflage.
2380	The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar
2381	until he's already being dragged, helpless,
2382	back to her lair.
2383	Now, the blouse.
2384	The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible
2385	to captivate her prey.
2386	If you're watching them bounce,
2387	she's about to pounce.
2388	See the claws?
2389	Long and sharp,
2390	to ward off rival females...
2391	or open alimony checks.
2392	Yeah, this one's a beaut.
2393	Okay, let the hunt begin.
2394	Wait, wait, wait. I'm not so sure I'm comfortable
2395	with you hunting my constitutional law professor.
2396	Who do you rather have grading your papers--
2397	a savage, man-eating jungle cat,
2398	or a purring, satisfied kitty?
2399	Go, Barney.
2400	Go mount and stuff that cougar.
2401	Scusi, I am Luigi, Italian exchange student.
2402	I was, uh, walking to class,
2403	but then I noticed you...
2404	bella principessa...
2405	Tell me what you want or get out.
2406	Direct.
2407	I like that.
2408	The name's Barney.
2409	What I want... is you.
2410	Turn around.
2411	My place. Two hours.
2412	Don't be tardy.
2413	I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people.
2414	And that building? Talk about overcompensating.
2415	He's not usually this bad.
2416	It's just that the partners have made it very clear
2417	this project is make or break for us,
2418	so lately he's been a little testy.
2419	You know what I mean-- crotchety.
2420	I'm just saying it's been hard on him.
2421	All right stop.
2422	- Did you show Lily your design? - No.
2423	- What design? - It's nothing.
2424	It's fantastic.
2425	Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design.
2426	And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia.
2427	At least, not healthy male genitalia.
2428	Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.
2429	Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers.
2430	He's a legend. I'm just part of his team.
2431	This building is huge for the firm,
2432	so it's really important we don't blow it.
2433	All right, enough.
2434	Oh, my God. Incredible.
2435	Hmm... C-minus.
2436	C-minus? What are you talking about?
2437	I just pulled an all-nighter!
2438	You didn't budget your time well,
2439	you glossed over some of the most important points,
2440	and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.
2441	Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees
2442	or waiting for them to sprout on their own.
2443	Then he stared at me until I laughed.
2444	Okay, I'm done.
2445	Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.
2446	Great. Thanks.
2447	Well, finally.
2448	I wondered whether you were making the trees
2449	or waiting for them to sprout on their own.
2450	Good one, sir.
2451	Anyway, here they are.
2452	- Too green. - Too green?
2453	Yes,  the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color.
2454	Almost brunette.
2455	And think bushier. I want this tower to rise
2456	from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery.
2457	Can you picture it, Ted?
2458	I can't un-picture it.
2459	Good.
2460	Oh, my God.
2461	It's gone!
2462	What? What's gone?
2463	My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.
2464	Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.
2465	What do you think, Ted,
2466	it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away?
2467	Somebody stole it.
2468	Well, um, I better get back to these Styrofoam trees.
2469	Oh, who cares about the trees?
2470	It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.
2471	Inspiring as always, sir.
2472	Lily?
2473	Where's she put those paints?
2474	Hey.
2475	Hey. Um, Lily, question for you.
2476	Why did I find  Mr. Druthers' baseball
2477	signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?
2478	That's easy. I took it.
2479	Why?
2480	It's simple.
2481	I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef.
2482	I guess you were sick the day they taught that at Sandwich University.
2483	Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you.
2484	I didn't get you a birthday present.
2485	What? You gonna cry?
2486	Little crybaby's going to cry?
2487	Hey, everybody, look!
2488	The little crybaby's gonna cry!
2489	I lost my ice cream!
2490	Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one,
2491	but the point is, he was mean.
2492	And that's why I took away his ball.
2493	What does his ball have to do with anything?
2494	Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that.
2495	When I was teaching kindergarten, whenever a kid was mean,
2496	I would take away one of his toys.
2497	The kid would be upset at first,
2498	but then he'd learn to stop being mean.
2499	Hey, guys. What's going on?
2500	Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.
2501	Why? Was he being mean?
2502	- You know about this? - Yeah.
2503	It's her own personal form of justice.
2504	Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?
2505	Oh, that was a good one.
2506	This sales guy was rude to Robin,
2507	so I took a pair of khakis.
2508	I gave them to you for your birthday.
2509	So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?
2510	I prefer to call them "justice khakis."
2511	That's not justice. It's shoplifting, and it's a crime.
2512	So is being mean.
2513	Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense.
2514	In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished.
2515	Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.
2516	Well, that's why I left a note.
2517	- A note? - Yeah.
2518	When  he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away,
2519	he'll stop being mean,
2520	and the office will be a nicer place to work.
2521	Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.
2522	Look, Lil, we're all tolerating
2523	this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having,
2524	with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny,
2525	but this is my career you're messing with.
2526	I'm not sure I like your tone.
2527	You know what?
2528	Now you just lost the ball.
2529	Hey.
2530	I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today.
2531	Nobody got higher than a C-minus.
2532	I know, I know.
2533	You claim to have so much sex.
2534	I only assumed you'd be good at it.
2535	Look, I miscalculated.
2536	I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars.
2537	But kitty's got claws.
2538	Don't worry though.
2539	Tonight, I'm seeing her again.
2540	Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.
2541	I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet,
2542	and I its master.
2543	I think I'm falling in love with you.
2544	Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it?
2545	Although that would explain a lot.
2546	What? No. We had sex yesterday.
2547	Oh, right. That.
2548	Well, you had sex yesterday.
2549	I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.
2550	When Druthers goes to get his bagel,
2551	I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back.
2552	If something goes wrong,
2553	yell out, "Who wants espresso?"
2554	so I'll know he's coming. Got it?
2555	Okay, now give me the ball.
2556	- No. - What do you mean, no?
2557	I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.
2558	Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.
2559	Everybody get in here now!
2560	Who wants espresso?
2561	Now, as most of you know,
2562	my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen.
2563	Well, I just found this note.
2564	"Dear Mr. Druthers, I, your baseball, am leaving.
2565	Maybe, if you start being nice, I'll come back.
2566	If not, other things in your office may follow my lead.
2567	In fact, I overheard your iPod talking,
2568	and he may shuffle off at any minute."
2569	Normally, I would scream at everyone until my voice goes,
2570	but maybe that's the wrong reaction here.
2571	Interesting.
2572	Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day
2573	to decide he's homesick,
2574	or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour.
2575	And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well,
2576	then you are gambling more than Pete Rose--
2577	major league baseball's all-time hit leader,
2578	a man whose absence from the Hall of Fame is a travesty
2579	to the entire sports world-- ever "allegedly" did!
2580	Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.
2581	Give him his ball back right now.
2582	People are going to get fired.
2583	No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted.
2584	I saw this in kindergarten all the time.
2585	This isn't kindergarten.
2586	Mr. Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.
2587	All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.
2588	No. You'll give it back or you're fired.
2589	I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.
2590	Then you're fired.
2591	Fine.
2592	Here's the ball.
2593	At least you have one now.
2594	Dude, you're killing me.
2595	You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.
2596	Do you not see the PowerBar in my hand?
2597	I'm fueling up.
2598	So you're going back over there?
2599	Oh, yeah.
2600	And tonight, just like John Mellencamp,
2601	I am going to get rid of the "Cougar" once and for all.
2602	Get it?
2603	'Cause that's what he did with his name.
2604	I can't stop thinking about you.
2605	Please give me another chance.
2606	Barney, I teach all day.
2607	It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.
2608	But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you,
2609	holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something.
2610	But, this time, no mercy. I don't care how long it takes--
2611	days, weeks, half a year.
2612	Fine. Come in.
2613	You can start while I finish grading some papers.
2614	Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment.
2615	Now, slide it closer to his chair.
2616	I want this thing to really smack him in the face.
2617	Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.
2618	Oh. Well, I pity her.
2619	I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note...
2620	You might say that Lily was mentally deranged.
2621	You might say that, Ted.
2622	Lily was mentally deranged.
2623	You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.
2624	Lily was mentally deranged!
2625	Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?
2626	The clients are here.
2627	Excellent. Bring them in.
2628	Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane.
2629	They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured
2630	the distinct flavor and history of the Northwest.
2631	Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
2632	the Spokane National Bank Building.
2633	That's a penis!
2634	That's... that's ridiculous.
2635	There's no way this majestic tower can be confused
2636	with the male organ of love.
2637	We're  not building a penis.
2638	You got any other ideas?
2639	Other ideas?
2640	You said you wanted Hammond Druthers.
2641	This is Hammond Druthers.
2642	Well, hats off to your ladyfriends,
2643	but I'm not building it.
2644	We're done here.
2645	The trajectory of my entire career might have been different
2646	had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.
2647	Wait!
2648	We have one more idea for you.
2649	Ted, what are you doing?
2650	I have another design.
2651	Sit down, shut up right now.
2652	No.
2653	# Thank you for the invitation #
2654	# She showed me very nice... #
2655	To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building
2656	over 70 stories probably!
2657	Probably!
2658	Congrats, Ted.
2659	Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers
2660	and pitch my idea.
2661	Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.
2662	Oh. You know what, Ted?
2663	That was very nice.
2664	You have earned these screws back.
2665	Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.
2666	Hey, I'm project manager now,
2667	so, if you want your old job back...
2668	No, thanks.
2669	I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.
2670	Casey, that's not how we treat people.
2671	You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.
2672	- Barney! Oh, my God! - What happened?
2673	He broke his hip.
2674	That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated.
2675	Seriously, I'm fine.
2676	No, he's not fine.
2677	Professor Lewis, hi.
2678	Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight.
2679	I was pleasantly surprised.
2680	Yeah, she was.
2681	B-plus.
2682	B-plus?!
2683	Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy,
2684	I am going to get you that "A"!
2685	Let her go.
2686	She belongs out there in the wild.
2687	You should feel proud.
2688	You fought the cougar and lived.
2689	It was an amazing safari.
2690	I can't wait to show you guys the slides.
2691	Transcript : Raceman Subtitles : Willow's Team www.forom.com
2692	- So, I guess that decides it. - Yup.
2693	Hanging out at a coffee place
2694	is not nearly as much fun as hanging out at a bar.
2695	Man, what's that?
2696	What?
2697	That cute coffee girl wrote a heart by your name.
2698	Somebody has a crush on you.
2699	Somebody thinks you're me.
2700	Do you really think she likes me?
2701	I mean, I guess  it's not that surprising.
2702	Every time I come in here, I totally crack her up.
2703	Marshall, here's your pumpkin latte.
2704	Wow. How did you fit a pumpkin in this little cup?
2705	I'll have a pumpkin latte.
2706	How do they even fit a pumpkin in those little cups?
2707	What? You got a shrink ray back there?
2708	Yeah.
2709	Hey, remember that time I said that thing
2710	about how do they fit a pumpkin into that little cup?
2711	- Which time? - The first time.
2712	Yeah. That was really funny.
2713	Right.
2714	All right, there's only two reasons she'd laugh at that.
2715	One, it's the first joke she's ever heard,
2716	or two, she likes you. You should totally ask her out.
2717	You think?
2718	Yeah, that why you're not back with Lily, right?
2719	So you can experience what it's like to be single.
2720	Well, what if the heart doesn't mean anything?
2721	What if she writes it on all the cups?
2722	Mine says "Ted," no heart.
2723	Mine says... "Swarley."
2724	How'd they get "Swarley" from "Barney"?
2725	It's not even a name.
2726	Who would ever be called "Swarley"?
2727	Oh, please don't start calling me "Swarley."
2728	This would never happen at a bar!
2729	Man! What's up with Swarley?
2730	I know. You almost never see old Swarlz get that upset.
2731	Hey, guess what?
2732	Oh, sorry.
2733	It's only my mom.
2734	She's just rambling on like always.
2735	What happened?
2736	Marshall asked out a girl.
2737	Wow.
2738	Well, if anything, that's Dad's fault.
2739	That'll keep her going a while.
2740	Oh, of course, you know, he had a little help.
2741	Swarley hooked him up?
2742	Oh, good. You got my text.
2743	- Yeah. - Oh. No, it was me.
2744	I gave Marshall one of my secrets.
2745	- So, what she say? - Nothing.
2746	I don't think she heard me. It's pretty busy up there.
2747	What? You gave her the look right?
2748	Head down, eyes looking up,
2749	hands in pockets, shoulders up,
2750	head slightly tilted, conveying shy vulnerability.
2751	I think so.
2752	Look, can we just go?
2753	Pumpkin latte for Marshall.
2754	I didn't order that.
2755	Phone number.
2756	I love that look.
2757	I think I slept with you because of that look.
2758	And it's fake?
2759	Oh, and you biting your lower lip, shyly looking away
2760	and thrusting your chest out is natural?
2761	Yeah, I hear you.
2762	- Hey! - Hey, guys.
2763	Are you free tomorrow night?
2764	I was thinking of having a wine tasting slash
2765	"help me catch the rat in my apartment" party.
2766	That's a great idea. You can put out cheese for both.
2767	I  should invite Marshall, right?
2768	It'd be weird if I didn't.
2769	Yeah, I don't think he can go.
2770	Really? Why not?
2771	Uh, okay, um...
2772	Lily, we have to tell you something.
2773	Marshall has a date.
2774	Oh. Well... good for him.
2775	Really? You're okay with it?
2776	Look, we've been broken up almost six months.
2777	I mean, I'm not thrilled about the idea,
2778	but he has every right to date someone else.
2779	That's very mature.
2780	Why are you holding the phone?
2781	Oh, shoot.
2782	That's hilarious, Mom.
2783	Didn't even notice.
2784	Hey, dude, by the way, I really like that suit.
2785	Tell me about the fabric. Is it foreign or something?
2786	Wow. It is foreign. I'm impressed, Ted.
2787	- It's Moroccan, actually. - Whoa.
2788	I got a call for Swarley.
2789	Is there a Swarley here?
2790	You weren't interested in my suit at all, were you?
2791	- Hmm? - Swarley!
2792	Yeah, I know he's there. It's really important.
2793	Could you ask again?
2794	Important call for Swarley!
2795	Geez, can't you hear him, Swarley? There's a call for you.
2796	Stop calling me that.
2797	Uh... Hey, I'd like you guys to officially meet Chloe.
2798	- Hi. - Hi.
2799	Hi.
2800	It's nice to meet you guys.
2801	- I'll be right back. - It's right back there.
2802	Right? Right? She's hot!
2803	And she likes me?
2804	She likes Italian food. I also like Italian food.
2805	She likes Billy Joel. I also like... music.
2806	And I think we're going to go out again.
2807	- Dude, you gotta ditch her. - Obviously.
2808	Why?
2809	She's got the crazy eyes.
2810	Dude. The eyes.
2811	They're crazy.
2812	What are you guys talking about, the crazy eyes?
2813	It's a well-documented condition of the pupils, or pupi.
2814	No. Just pupils.
2815	It's an indicator of future mental instability.
2816	She does not have the crazy eyes.
2817	You just can't see it because you're afflicted
2818	with "haven't been laid in a while" blindness.
2819	She was too far away in the coffee place,
2820	but when I saw her up close just now...
2821	Hey, I'd like you guys to officially meet Chloe.
2822	- Hi. - Hi.
2823	Hi.
2824	It's nice to meet you guys.
2825	You  guys, I'm not going to stop dating Chloe
2826	just because you think she has the crazy eyes.
2827	You can keep going out with her, but you're gonna regret it.
2828	One time, I met a girl at this very bar.
2829	I saw that she had the crazy eyes...
2830	...but I ignored it.
2831	And then, sure enough.
2832	Barney, can I ask you a question?
2833	Anything.
2834	Would you like to have a threesome?
2835	Of course.
2836	Great. It'll be you, me and Mr. Weasels.
2837	So, did you do it?
2838	No. It ended up being just a twosome
2839	with the third one watching from a chair.
2840	Which one were you?
2841	I'd rather not say.
2842	Look, there was a time I didn't believe in the crazy eyes either,
2843	and then I met Jeanine.
2844	She had serious crazy eyes.
2845	I told myself I was  just imagining it, but then...
2846	So, should we go get a drink?
2847	As long as it's in your apartment.
2848	Whoa, I'm sorry.
2849	Watch! Where! You're! Going!
2850	So, where do you live?
2851	You guys, Chloe is not  gonna do any of that stuff.
2852	She's a nice girl from Nebraska.
2853	She's not crazy.
2854	She's... she's awesome.
2855	But you can't avoid the crazy eyes forever.
2856	Sooner or later, the crazy  comes bubbling to the surface.
2857	Hello?
2858	Marshall, it's Chloe.
2859	Are you the one who's called me like nine times?
2860	Yeah. Could you come get me?
2861	I'm in the middle of taking a test.
2862	Please. I'm so scared.
2863	Well, what's going on?
2864	This weird midget guy started following me
2865	and he was screaming at me
2866	and he had a limp and a big hump on his back
2867	and the police didn't believe me
2868	and I almost got trampled by a horse and...
2869	God I must sound totally crazy to you right now.
2870	No. Pfft.
2871	Not at all.
2872	So, she's needy crazy.
2873	That's one of the worst kinds.
2874	I've had one of those.
2875	Makes  up stories to get attention.
2876	Went out with her for three weeks-- her dad died twice.
2877	Guys, she was really freaked out, okay?
2878	Maybe the story is true.
2879	What in the world would make you believe that's a true story?
2880	She's really hot.
2881	They always are.
2882	- You all done with that, Ted? - Yeah.
2883	Ned. I told you to call him Ned.
2884	That's just sad.
2885	Sorry, Swarley.
2886	So, do just you and Ted live here
2887	or does Swarley live here, too?
2888	Nah. Swarley has his own place.
2889	What was that?
2890	Oh, I, uh, dropped my keys.
2891	So, here you go.
2892	Two pumpkin beers.
2893	I was joking. They're regular beers.
2894	What is that?
2895	This picture is broken.
2896	Oh. That's too bad.
2897	Is that Lily?
2898	Is that the girl you were going to marry?
2899	Yeah. Is that what that sound was?
2900	Did you just smash this?
2901	No.
2902	Why would I do that?
2903	Let me look into your eyes.
2904	Okay.
2905	I had a really nice time tonight.
2906	Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.
2907	I  like your eyes a lot, too.
2908	S top!
2909	Hi. I'm Lily.
2910	Stop!
2911	Now, kids, I know Lily hiding in the apartment
2912	while Marshall was on a date with another girl seems pretty crazy,
2913	but when you hear her side of the story,
2914	well, it's still pretty crazy.
2915	What's up Swarlz?
2916	No. Okay? No. No more.
2917	I will not let this  become a thing. It's over.
2918	No more Swarley. No Swarlz.
2919	No more Swar-lay.
2920	No more Swar... wait for it... ley.
2921	No more Bob Swarley, mon.
2922	No more. No! It's over.
2923	Do you understand?
2924	- Yes. - Yes.
2925	Thank you.
2926	Nice.
2927	- Why didn't you call me? - Was I supposed to call you?
2928	Yes, about the whole Marshall- dating-another-girl thing.
2929	You said you were fine with it.
2930	Yeah, in front of Ted, but then I shot you a look.
2931	- What look? - This.
2932	That doesn't seem like a look.
2933	Yes it is. It means,  "I'm upset call me later."
2934	You should have pulled me aside and told me what the look meant.
2935	If I pulled you aside, I wouldn't need the look.
2936	Well, maybe if it was a more distinctive look...
2937	Okay, the look isn't important.
2938	What's important is that I can't stand the idea
2939	of Marshall dating another woman.
2940	I mean, what if  he falls in love with her?
2941	Well, if it makes you feel any better,
2942	Ted says she has the crazy eyes.
2943	What's that?
2944	Apparently, a thing women have that guys can see
2945	and it tells them that the girl's crazy.
2946	Oh, kind of like how you never want to date a guy
2947	with perfect fingernails?
2948	Jerk nails. Exactly.
2949	Well, did-did Ted say whether she was good-looking?
2950	I mean, 'cause if I knew she was ugly,
2951	then maybe I wouldn't be so freaked out.
2952	Uh, he didn't say, but you can find out.
2953	I think her name is Chloe-- she works at Cosa Coffee on 78th.
2954	Phone call for Swarles Barkley?
2955	Hey, Ted. No, he's not here.
2956	Good one, though-- remember that one.
2957	Is, um, Chloe here?
2958	She just left. You can probably still catch her.
2959	She's easy to spot-- she's got a pink umbrella.
2960	Oh, thanks, Brian.
2961	My name is Scott.
2962	Your tag says Brian.
2963	I know. Funny story.
2964	So, I wake up this morning, and...
2965	Yeah, see you later, Brian.
2966	There she is.
2967	She doesn't look that great.
2968	She's not fat, but that doesn't mean anything.
2969	I know tons of skinny, ugly women.
2970	That's right, snotty girl in my yoga class,
2971	I'm talking to you.
2972	Come on, Chloe, turn around.
2973	Here we go. Turn around, Chloe.
2974	Come on, show me that hideous face.
2975	Damn it!
2976	Ooh, I know, I'll get ahead of her,
2977	then I'll cut back so I... Aah!
2978	Oh, my God, that hurts!
2979	Turn around! Come on!
2980	Just turn around!
2981	Okay, this is ridiculous.
2982	Hey!
2983	Turn around! What's the matter with you?
2984	Hey, you!
2985	Turn around!
2986	Turn around, Chloe!
2987	She's hot? I'm so sorry.
2988	No, it's fine.
2989	I-It just makes things easier.
2990	Now that I know she's a threat,
2991	all I have to do is keep Marshall from ever seeing her again.
2992	Okay, I have two plans-- you can help me choose.
2993	Plan A--
2994	remember that time Marshall and I had sex in the bathroom?
2995	Oops, I got knocked up.
2996	- Lily. - Okay, plan B
2997	is called "Chloe's Accident."
2998	- Just stop. - What?
2999	Lily, you can't do any of those things.
3000	If you two are ever gonna get back together,
3001	you have to let him work out whatever this is.
3002	I know. You're right.
3003	Now, come on, Ted asked us to be upstairs at 6:00.
3004	Some surprise for Barney.
3005	- Barney? - Uh, Swarley.
3006	- Hey, guys. - Hey.
3007	Where's Marshall?
3008	Oh, he's getting a haircut.
3009	Oh. For his date.
3010	Good for him.
3011	Hope he has a good time tonight.
3012	Relax, you've got nothing to worry about.
3013	The girl's crazy.
3014	Thanks!
3015	He'll just have wild monkey sex with her five times, max,
3016	and be done with her.
3017	Thanks again.
3018	What are you doing?
3019	I just wanted to listen to a little music, that's all.
3020	And this next one's going out to Swarley.
3021	All your friends know you miss Barney,
3022	but he's gone, and you got to accept that, baby.
3023	And, Swarley, you're gonna be  a better woman for it.
3024	Here's "I Am Woman" by Helen Reddy.
3025	Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman. I love it!
3026	You know, I was thinking about this whole new name thing last night,
3027	and you know what I realized? I like it.
3028	You like being called Swarley?
3029	Are you kidding? I want you to call me that.
3030	Do you really think this is gonna work?
3031	Do I think what's gonna work? I'm just saying, I love my new name,
3032	so please only call me that from now on.
3033	Call you what?
3034	You know, that-that-that new name that you've been calling me.
3035	Say it.
3036	Why? You guys know what it is.
3037	Say the name.
3038	No, I don't want to! I hate it!
3039	I hate it! It's not funny!
3040	It's never been funny! I've never done any...
3041	No!
3042	Man, he is really gonna lose it
3043	when all the magazine subscriptions start coming in.
3044	I signed him up for People in Espanol,
3045	but I addressed it to Swarlos.
3046	Hey, where's the picture of Marshall and me at the pier?
3047	Didn't it used to be by that window?
3048	Oh, yeah, he, uh, he sort of took it down when you left.
3049	Put it behind some books, I think.
3050	Oh, well-well, maybe I should put it back up.
3051	Why, so Chloe'll see it and get scared off?
3052	No.
3053	So Marshall'll see it and feel guilty.
3054	Yeah, okay.
3055	But she wasn't okay.
3056	Later that night, while Marshall was on his date,
3057	Lily came back.
3058	...anymore.
3059	Pretty impressive, huh?
3060	Wow, you really did memorize all the lyrics to "We Didn't Start the Fire."
3061	Can I, uh, can I get you a drink?
3062	I'd love a beer.
3063	You got it.
3064	Lily did what any sensible woman would do.
3065	She hid under the desk.
3066	And she stayed there, listening to her ex-fiance
3067	on a date with another woman.
3068	I had a really nice time tonight.
3069	Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.
3070	I like your eyes a lot, too.
3071	Finally, much like Billy Joel,
3072	she couldn't take it anymore.
3073	Stop!
3074	Hi.  I'm Lily.
3075	Lily... Lily, what the hell are you doing?
3076	I don't know. I... I don't know... what I'm doing.
3077	Oh, pumpkin beer-- that was a good one.
3078	I'm just... I'm gonna go. I... I'm so sorry.
3079	En-Enjoy the rest of your date.
3080	She seems nice.
3081	- Lilly, what the hell... - I'm sorry.
3082	I only snuck up there because...
3083	when I saw how cute she was yesterday, I freaked out.
3084	Lily, you saw her yesterday?
3085	Yeah, I... kind of chased her down the street.
3086	Wait, so you were the hunchback with the limp?
3087	Yeah.
3088	And she didn't break the picture, I did.
3089	So Chloe's not crazy, she's...
3090	just a nice, normal girl.
3091	Yeah, she is.
3092	And you deserve a nice, normal girl.
3093	So, why don't you just go back up there
3094	and-and finish your date.
3095	Yeah.
3096	Okay.
3097	Okay.
3098	Wait, if you were the hunchback, then why did she think you were a guy?
3099	I-I might have used a voice that sounded like this.
3100	- Why? - Because I didn't want
3101	her to know it was me, which  I now realize doesn't make sense,
3102	because she hadn't even met me.
3103	You're crazy.
3104	You have... crazier eyes than anybody that I have ever met.
3105	Shouldn't you be going back up...
3106	I mean, you're out of your mind.
3107	You're... just absolutely insane.
3108	Shouldn't you be going back upstairs?
3109	I've missed you so much.
3110	Okay, I ran it by the group,
3111	and we decided we're gonna give you a choice.
3112	We will agree to stop calling you Swarley,
3113	but instead, we'll call you Jennifer.
3114	Well?
3115	I'm thinking.
3116	How about this? On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays...
3117	Hey.
3118	Look at this.
3119	So right there, in the exact same place
3120	that six months earlier I had walked up and found Marshall alone,
3121	crying over his breakup with Lily, I found him again.
3122	Only this time he wasn't alone,
3123	and he was happy.
3124	So we went to the bar to celebrate, and it was great.
3125	I was with Robin, Marshall and Lily were back together,
3126	and Barney had a cool new name.
3127	All was right with the world...
3128	until we got back to the apartment.
3129	Oh, my God.
3130	Hey, Chloe, I...
3131	guess I forgot I left you up here.
3132	I was gonna leave, but I can't find my keys.
3133	They're right there on the coffee table.
3134	Silly me.
3135	I must have looked everywhere else.
3136	Well... I'm just gonna go.
3137	Oh, I don't think we've met. I'm Chloe.
3138	Robin.
3139	It's nice to meet you, Roland.
3140	I'll see you guys later.
3141	Roland?
3142	Your name's Roland.
3143	That's funny, right?
3144	Rock and Roland.
3145	Warsaw is the capital of what? Roland.
3146	You're Monica Roland-ski.
3147	Hey, yeah, that's just how I Roland.
3148	- Nice try, Swarley. - Damn it.
3149	Swarley!
3150	# Sometimes you want to go #
3151	# Where everybody # # knows your name #
3152	# And they're always # # glad you came... #
3153	And so, after six months apart,
3154	Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall were finally back together.
3155	Oh, my God.
3156	These pancakes are delicious!
3157	Yes. Thank you.
3158	Um, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer.
3159	Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight?
3160	Yeah, sure.
3161	How about pancakes?
3162	And things were back to normal... almost.
3163	You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy
3164	who knows how to make pancakes.
3165	Oh, um...
3166	I mean, um...
3167	Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed
3168	whether us getting back together means us getting married, but...
3169	I still wanna.
3170	Do you still wanna?
3171	Really?
3172	Of course, I love you.
3173	No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it?
3174	"Do you still wanna?" That's like the lamest proposal ever.
3175	When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying.
3176	Marshall Eriksen, will you ma...
3177	- No, no, no, no, no, no. - What?!
3178	You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that.
3179	You got to have, like, a little speech.
3180	Do you remember your proposal to me?
3181	I had a speech prepared.
3182	What do you want to hear?
3183	I don't know. I mean, you could tell me,
3184	like, about how good-looking and funny and smart I am
3185	and I've been working out lately.
3186	It might be nice for you to mention something... about that.
3187	Marshall...
3188	- you are good-looking... - Thank you.
3189	- You're funny. - Oh, thanks.
3190	- You're smart. - And a few tears wouldn't hurt.
3191	Okay, would you freakin' marry me already?
3192	I'll marry you. Of course.
3193	But, um, until you see a ring on this finger, don't expect me to put out.
3194	Yeah, right.
3195	Transcript : Raceman Subtitles : Willow's Team
3196	www.forom.com
3197	I'll give you this.
3198	That was a very creative use of syrup.
3199	I can't even look Mrs. Butterworth in the eye.
3200	Oh, my God. We're getting married!
3201	I know, I know.
3202	It was a moment of happiness,
3203	followed of course by a moment of total panic.
3204	See, when they called off their first wedding,
3205	Aunt Lily took off for San Francisco
3206	leaving Uncle Marshall with the unfortunate task
3207	of telling his entire family.
3208	Yeah, so now she's gone and the wedding's off.
3209	What do you call someone who just takes off and leaves like that?
3210	What do you call that?
3211	I think that that's a little strong.
3212	I can't even believe you would use a word like that.
3213	Geez, Grandma.
3214	Man, I made a big mess by canceling this wedding, didn't I?
3215	It's okay, baby.
3216	You're not just realizing that now, are you?
3217	God, the idea of standing up there in front of all those people
3218	who hate my guts...
3219	just makes me want to run off to Atlantic City and get married today.
3220	Yeah.
3221	Coming up at 11:00: Are there piranhas in the East River?
3222	What you don't know... could eat you.
3223	Robin! Stop the news!
3224	- What the hell?  - It's okay. They're my friends.
3225	We're going to Atlantic City to elope. You got to come with us.
3226	Oh, my God, that is so fantastic!
3227	I-I don't know if I can just leave work.
3228	It's okay; Mike can read the news tonight.
3229	Hey,  Mike... you can read, right?
3230	Yeah, I'm the best at reading.
3231	- Let's go to Atlantic City! - Yeah!
3232	You guys are eloping! Oh, that's fantastic.
3233	Wait, is this because there's a time crunch Uncle Ted should know about?
3234	I hope not because I plan on getting hammered.
3235	Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work.
3236	I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager.
3237	Ted, for the rest of our lives,
3238	we are going to be telling the amazing story
3239	of how we went to Atlantic City and got married.
3240	Don't you want to be in that story?
3241	Of course I do.
3242	- Let's go to Atlantic City! - Yeah!
3243	Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?
3244	You got it.
3245	Hey, guys.
3246	Wow. A pedicure.
3247	Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure
3248	I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.
3249	We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!
3250	Oh, congratulations, Lily.
3251	Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?
3252	So are you in or not?
3253	Hell, yeah, I'm in!
3254	Just... I'm almost done.
3255	- No, we got to get going to the... - Well, actually, I mean...
3256	It is my wedding day, and since we're here...
3257	So we all got a pedicure and then headed down...
3258	to Atlantic City.
3259	Wow. Look at this place.
3260	I guess I'll have my pick of something old.
3261	And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.
3262	Ah, A.C., always in decline,
3263	never hitting bottom.
3264	It's good to be back, old friend.
3265	You been here before?
3266	Oh, uh, once or twice.
3267	Barney!
3268	Ah, good to see you, too.
3269	Three times, maybe.
3270	The wedding chapel-- this is it.
3271	Are you ready to do this?
3272	I'm  ready.
3273	- Let's get married. - Yeah.
3274	Oh, crap. I don't have a veil.
3275	I'm a bride; I can't get married without a veil.
3276	And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet.
3277	Oh, my God, we're getting married.
3278	Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey.
3279	Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit.
3280	Oh, really? Thanks.
3281	Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride; you can't look better than me.
3282	Done.
3283	I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil.
3284	We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes.
3285	Ready,  break.
3286	You guys want to go gamble?
3287	No, we got to go get the veil.
3288	Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one.
3289	Yeah, okay.
3290	No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil.
3291	So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life.
3292	- I'm proud of you, buddy. - Thanks.
3293	- How are you feeling? - Great, a little nervous.
3294	- Yeah? Craps? - Not that nervous.
3295	- No, I mean do you want to play craps. - Oh, yeah, definitely.
3296	Okay, I got the veil.
3297	She wasn't ready to be married.
3298	All right, let's talk bachelor party.
3299	Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room
3300	and have a private toy show-- whew.
3301	What did you just say?
3302	- Barney, no. - Marshall, I'm your best man.
3303	- You're not my best man. - Right here.
3304	And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party.
3305	That's part of being a best friend.
3306	- You're not my best friend. - Right here.
3307	Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party.
3308	I've got, like, 18 minutes.
3309	18 minutes.
3310	Oh, good. Did you get the veil?
3311	Of course.
3312	And it took us exactly 18 minutes.
3313	We went to a strip club.
3314	- Dude! - Unbelievable!
3315	We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time
3316	to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.
3317	- Your last lap dance ever. - Right...
3318	What?
3319	Okay, I'm here. Right?
3320	Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City.
3321	Does it smell like strippers in here?
3322	That's weird, right?
3323	Marshall and Lily are getting married!
3324	Hell, yeah, look at this.
3325	Oh, baby, this is it.
3326	- Let's do this thing. - All right.
3327	Hi. We're here to get married.
3328	Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages
3329	to give you the special day you've always dreamed about.
3330	We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine.
3331	Yeah.
3332	You know this isn't Vegas, right?
3333	Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen.
3334	Here, it looks like everyone brought their own.
3335	What?
3336	It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey.
3337	The earliest I could book you for is Monday.
3338	No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point.
3339	Look, I don't know what to say,
3340	but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday
3341	or play a round of keno, I can't help you.
3342	Thirty-five.
3343	Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time.
3344	Yes, they do, but they don't elope.
3345	They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches,
3346	world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel.
3347	Have you been outside?
3348	There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.
3349	You guys, take it easy, guys.
3350	Are you sure about this?
3351	About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel?
3352	Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
3353	Bright side: the bachelor party continues!
3354	Yes!
3355	Continues? You mean "start." He means "start."
3356	We went to a strip club.
3357	Twenty-seven.
3358	Is there any way that we could get a license today?
3359	You could go to the courthouse.
3360	In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived,
3361	but you have to have a good reason.
3362	Well, we're in love.
3363	What better reason could there be?
3364	The last one I heard was,
3365	"I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country,"
3366	but, you know, give yours a whirl.
3367	So we went to the courthouse.
3368	God, this is taking forever.
3369	Can't believe they're getting married.
3370	I know.
3371	I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through.
3372	In fact, that crazy road has led them
3373	all the way here to Atlantic City.
3374	Ted, up here.
3375	You were just staring at my shirt boobs.
3376	No! I wasn't.
3377	I-I was checking out the hot bod underneath the shirt.
3378	Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt,
3379	but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt.
3380	Hey, it's Barney!
3381	- Barney! - Hi.
3382	...suit up.
3383	...legend.
3384	...Daddy.
3385	American daddy.
3386	What the hell was that?
3387	A... Chinese guy?
3388	Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license,
3389	but we need to skip the waiting period because...
3390	we're in love.
3391	Aw. I'm gonna waive this waiting period right now.
3392	Oh, really?!
3393	Is what I would say if I could waive the waiting period,
3394	but unfortunately, only a judge can do that.
3395	Oh. Well, so can we see a judge?
3396	- Absolutely. - Really?!
3397	Is what I would say if there was any chance of you seeing a judge today,
3398	which there isn't.
3399	Why are you doing this to us?!
3400	'Cause you're on Candid Camera!
3401	- Really?! - Is what I would say...
3402	You know what? We get it.
3403	Okay, this is a good plan B.
3404	Judges are people. People go to the batoom.
3405	A judge is bound to come by eventually,
3406	and we'll get married.
3407	I'm  sure we won't be waiting long.
3408	Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.
3409	Vultures.
3410	What?
3411	Here?
3412	Yeah. Got a little time to kill.
3413	Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?
3414	No.
3415	A little.
3416	Something is seriously wrong with you.
3417	So what, is that a no?
3418	- All right, let's do it. - All right.
3419	Um, also...?
3420	- Yes, I'll leave it on. - Sweet.
3421	Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen.
3422	Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster,
3423	but believe me, it's better than the alternative.
3424	You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food
3425	and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college?
3426	Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet.
3427	Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!
3428	- Turn it off. - Okay.
3429	May we please get married today?
3430	Now, normally I would say no to a request like that,
3431	but you two impress me.
3432	Just  the fact that you've been together for ten years,
3433	standing by each other's side through thick and thin,
3434	never wavering.
3435	- What was that? - What was what?
3436	That little look. What was that?
3437	A look of love.
3438	You two have stood together through thick and thin, right?
3439	- You know, what's thick, what's thin? - Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.
3440	I have.
3441	All right, what was that look?
3442	What's going on?
3443	They broke up over the summer.
3444	Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had sex in the closet.
3445	What? We're under oath.
3446	No, we're not.
3447	Yeah, we are. He's a judge.
3448	Wh-- did we take an oath?
3449	Do you even know what an oath is?
3450	Uh, yeah. Courthouse.
3451	Oath. We're under it.
3452	Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.
3453	No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today.
3454	Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license.
3455	Except international waters.
3456	So-so let's find a ship captain.
3457	A ship captain can marry us.
3458	There's boats all over this place.
3459	Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?
3460	This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go.
3461	Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?
3462	This is my machine.
3463	- I should go talk to her. - No, let me.
3464	- Blackjack? - Yeah.
3465	Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip,
3466	so we're getting closer.
3467	Okay, Lil, why is it  so important to do this today?
3468	Because... if we don't do it today,
3469	I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding
3470	with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people
3471	looking all disapproving and judging me
3472	while sipping little cups of mayonnaise
3473	and-and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long.
3474	- Nobody's gonna do that. - No, they're not
3475	because I'm not gonna give them the chance.
3476	I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight.
3477	Sweetie, this is crazy.
3478	You're never gonna find a ship capt...
3479	Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain.
3480	- What? - Yeah.
3481	First guy we talked to. Ship captain.
3482	How great is that?
3483	See? See, this is destiny.
3484	So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us?
3485	I sure can.
3486	If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage
3487	- and making $5,000. - What?
3488	Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody.
3489	Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.
3490	I can get us that money.
3491	How?
3492	Have you noticed that all day today
3493	Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?
3494	Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it
3495	because I'm too scared of the answer?
3496	Well, those are my old gambling buddies.
3497	Truth  is... I used to come here all the time.
3498	Play an old Chinese game called "Shing Hasabu Shing".
3499	Had a small gambling problem.
3500	Actually, it wasn't so small. I...
3501	kind of lost my entire life's savings.
3502	But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot.
3503	I think I can win us that money.
3504	No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.
3505	Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win.
3506	I'll get us that money.
3507	I swear it, nay...
3508	I oath it.
3509	Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night,
3510	and I've been to a lot of casinos since,
3511	but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one.
3512	To this day, I have no idea how it was played.
3513	But luckily, Barney did.
3514	Do you understand what's happening?
3515	Not a clue.
3516	Do you think he's winning?
3517	I don't even know if he's playing.
3518	Wait, I get it. I understand this game.
3519	No, you don't.
3520	I totally understand the game, Theodore.
3521	Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean.
3522	Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm...
3523	My God, you're right.
3524	Wow. It's beautiful.
3525	Thanks, Barney.
3526	Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight.
3527	Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore.
3528	God, I love gambling!
3529	When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?
3530	Why can't I do it just a little?
3531	Okay.
3532	Let's get this started.
3533	Okay, uh...
3534	you guys want the serious one or the funny one?
3535	Oh, I think... serious would be best.
3536	You sure? I got a lot of great nautical jokes in there.
3537	Like how you two float each other's boat, stuff like that.
3538	Yeah, serious is probably good.
3539	"We stand witness today
3540	"to celebrate the union of Lily and Marshall.
3541	"Today, you two will become one,
3542	"sharing your lives,
3543	"the happiness, the sadness,
3544	"the frustrations and the joy..."
3545	This is pretty cool.
3546	I can't believe you never want to get married.
3547	I never said "never."
3548	"...to declare your love
3549	"and devotion to each other
3550	"in front of friends and family,
3551	"all the people who matter most to you."
3552	What was that?
3553	What was what?
3554	That little look. You two just shared a look.
3555	- We don't want to do this. - We don't.
3556	Are you kidding me?
3557	You guys are calling off another wedding?
3558	After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?
3559	Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?
3560	You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?
3561	Yes.
3562	'Cause it's gonna be amazing.
3563	Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family
3564	and-and I didn't want to do all that work, but...
3565	now that we're here...
3566	I realize that I have to face Marshall's family
3567	and I really want to do all that work.
3568	So do I.
3569	And yeah... my family  might still be upset with you.
3570	But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other
3571	and none of that other stuff is gonna matter.
3572	- I love you, Marshall. - I love you, too, Lily pad.
3573	I now pronounce you man and wife.
3574	- What?! - What?!
3575	What, is that not right?
3576	Are... we married? Did you just marry us?
3577	Weren't you listening? We don't want to be married.
3578	Uh... I-I suppose I could unpronounce you.
3579	- Unpronounce us. - Unpronounce us!
3580	All right, I unpronounce you man and wife.
3581	Oh, whew... that was close.
3582	And that's the story of how Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily
3583	got married for 12 seconds
3584	somewhere off the coast of Atlantic City.
3585	- Hey, guys. - Hey.
3586	Ted.
3587	Is Robin here?
3588	Man, I hope so.
3589	..learn about relationships is that you're never done
3590	getting to know someone.
3591	Everyone has secrets.
3592	Some are nice.
3593	You know how to make crepes?
3594	That is so cool.
3595	Some aren't as nice.
3596	And then there was Derek, and counting you,
3597	- that puts the total up to-- - Oh, I got your total.
3598	I've been counting along.
3599	And some are just weird.
3600	You're scared of the seven dwarfs?
3601	Just Doc. He's creepy.
3602	I mean the guy went to medical school.
3603	What's he doing living with six coal miners?
3604	Oh, man! I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night.
3605	- I bet you guys couldn't either. - Why?
3606	Only the Gala event for the Grand Opening
3607	of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?
3608	No, I blocked your address after the fourth time
3609	you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.
3610	Come on! It's on me. I'm buying three of you foot massagers
3611	and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.
3612	Come on, let's go.
3613	Okay, I'm in.
3614	- To the Willowbrook Mall! - To the Willowbrook Mall.
3615	Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.
3616	What? Why not?
3617	I just don't feel like going to a mall.
3618	We can split a Cinnabon.
3619	No, I'm really not going to go.
3620	- Come on, it'll be fun. - No, I don't go to malls!
3621	Sorry, I just don't like malls.
3622	Why not?
3623	I'd rather not say.
3624	- Sharper Images. - But that's where clothes live.
3625	Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls.
3626	If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to.
3627	I think we should all just respect her privacy.
3628	Thanks, Ted.
3629	So, what's the deal with you and malls?
3630	I thought you said that, if I didn't want to talk about it,
3631	I didn't have to.
3632	Yeah, with those people.
3633	But I'm your boyfriend. Come on. What is it?
3634	Did you get arrested at a mall?
3635	No.
3636	- Dumped at a mall? - Ted.
3637	Found out you were Canadian at a mall?
3638	Let it go.
3639	Trapped under a fake boulder at a mall?
3640	- Let it go. - Mauled at the mall?
3641	Let it go!
3642	And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall?
3643	Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure.
3644	I don't get it. Why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?
3645	Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret.
3646	The more you learn about a person,
3647	the better chance you have of hitting the fatal "Oh" moment.
3648	The "Oh" moment?
3649	Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person
3650	that is going to be a deal breaker.
3651	It's a promise ring.
3652	I made a pact with God to stay a virgin till I'm married.
3653	I don't have an eating disorder.
3654	It's just when I put food in my mouth, I chew it, and then I spit it out.
3655	I just turned 30.
3656	So trust me, you want to postpone
3657	knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.
3658	Mmm. I disagree. If there is some potential "Oh" moment,
3659	I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?
3660	I now pronounce you, man and wife.
3661	I love you.
3662	I used to be a dude.
3663	Yeah, I agree with Ted.
3664	In a real relationship, you share everything.
3665	That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.
3666	You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter.
3667	Go  play a song on the jukebox.
3668	No, it's true. They tell each other everything.
3669	I can think of tons of things, there's no way Marshall's told you.
3670	Try me.
3671	Do you know about the time Marshall was in Trenton?
3672	Donkey ate his pants. Yup.
3673	Bill's bachelor party in Memphis?
3674	Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?
3675	Wow. Okay. Seattle.
3676	Trick question. Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest
3677	because he's afraid of Sasquatch.
3678	Damn, you're good.
3679	I'm not afraid of Sasquatch, I just think we should all be on alert.
3680	Trust me. Not only do they tell each other everything,
3681	they want to know everything.
3682	So after the shower I was brushing my teeth. And I was like,
3683	"Oh, man! I wanted to have some orange juice.
3684	I should have done that first."
3685	But I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush.
3686	So I just went ahead and brushed them anyway.
3687	What happened next?
3688	Yeah, meanwhile, Robin tells me nothing.
3689	Fine. Do you want to know what Robin's secret is?
3690	You know?
3691	Of course I know.
3692	She couldn't look at us, her face got flushed--
3693	that's shame, my friend.
3694	Our friend Robin used to do porn, wait for it...
3695	...ography.
3696	Yeah, we didn't really need to wait for that.
3697	And it's ridiculous.
3698	I don't know. He could be right.
3699	She does have the fake orgasm noises down.
3700	Hey!
3701	What? The walls are thin.
3702	That's not what I'm "hey"ing you about.
3703	You know what it might be?
3704	This is going to sound a little crazy but what if Robin is married?
3705	Married? What does that have to do with the mall?
3706	Well, maybe she got married at the mall.
3707	Back home in Minnesota, a ton of people get married
3708	at the Mall of America. It's great.
3709	There's this gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures,
3710	numerous fine dining options, and talk about a reasonable--
3711	- We are not getting married at the mall! - Well, just meet with the guy.
3712	She's not married. Robin hates marriage.
3713	Because she already got married.
3714	At the mall.
3715	No,  because before Robin moved to New York, she...
3716	What was she doing?
3717	Well, I don't know. Whenever I ask her about Canada,
3718	she kind of clams up.
3719	She's  a pretty private person.
3720	Except when she's talking about...
3721	Oh, a friend of mine in Canada got married way too young
3722	and it really turned her off to marriage.
3723	What do you think of this wedding cake?
3724	Oh, I like it.
3725	Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada
3726	who got married way too young?
3727	Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Fields' giant cookie.
3728	No.
3729	My friend in Canada who got married way too young,
3730	they had to do their vows twice, once in French.
3731	They speak French there, too?
3732	God, that place is a mess.
3733	So you don't think there's any "friend" from Canada?
3734	Oh, I'm sure there is.
3735	Just like I have a "friend" who wet his bed till he was ten.
3736	Use your brain, Ted.
3737	Guys, there's no way Robin is married.
3738	It's ludicrous to even suggest it.
3739	- Thank you, Barney. - 'Cause it's porn.
3740	I need another beer.
3741	Robin was not in porn. I bet you anything that she's married.
3742	$20,000 says it's porn.
3743	I don't have $20,000.
3744	Well, then what do you have?
3745	- Well... - No.
3746	I've got it. The ultimate wager--
3747	slap bet.
3748	Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.
3749	What the hell's a slap bet?
3750	Whoever is right gets to slap the other person in the face
3751	as hard as they possibly can-- but no rings.
3752	Are you really going to do that? That's so immature.
3753	- You can be Slap Bet Commissioner. - Ooh, I love it. What are my powers?
3754	Um, if a problem arises and we need a ruling, that's your job.
3755	But you have to be unbiased
3756	and put the integrity of slap bet above all else.
3757	This is an honor you will take with you to your grave.
3758	On your tombstone, it will read,
3759	"Lily Aldrin, caring wife, loving friend,
3760	Slap Bet Commissioner."
3761	And your tombstone will read "Got slapped by Marshall, so hard he died."
3762	Okay. What if I just ask Robin point blank if she has a husband?
3763	You said you would respect her privacy,
3764	so maybe you should just drop it.
3765	Yeah, you're right.
3766	Husband.
3767	There's no "P" in husband.
3768	Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.
3769	Fine. I'll take it back.
3770	Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're going to love this.
3771	Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason
3772	you didn't want to go to the mall the other day
3773	is because you got married at a mall and have a husband in Canada.
3774	I told him he's crazy. Because he's crazy, right?
3775	I mean, how crazy is that?
3776	Are you asking me if I'm married?
3777	Well, you can ask me.
3778	Nope, I'm not married. Your turn.
3779	What happened to respecting my privacy?
3780	Look, just say, "No, I'm not married."
3781	Ted, I don't understand why you can't--
3782	Just say, "No, I'm not married."
3783	I can't.
3784	Marshall's right.
3785	I was young and I got married.
3786	It was a mistake and he moved away, but...
3787	yeah. I'm married.
3788	You have a husband?
3789	I was young and stupid
3790	and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall
3791	and I... I haven't been to a mall since.
3792	Why didn't you get divorced?
3793	He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like...
3794	eh, good enough.
3795	Good enough? That's not good enough.
3796	You  order pancakes, you get waffles, that's good enough.
3797	Look, I haven't seen him in years.
3798	It's just a part of my life I want to forget.
3799	Just please don't tell anyone about this.
3800	Okay.
3801	Dude, your hand is monstrous.
3802	Yeah, well, what'd you expect? You've seen my penis.
3803	I can't believe you told us Robin's secret.
3804	What? How could I keep something like that to myself?
3805	And you begged me to tell you.
3806	No, I didn't.
3807	Please tell us. Just tell us. I'm begging you.
3808	Tell us. Tell us. Tell us. Please please please--
3809	Fine. Robin's married.
3810	Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us.
3811	I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?
3812	See that's just it, I'm not the boyfriend.
3813	I'm the mistress.
3814	No, not the mistress.
3815	The mastress.
3816	The master. What do you call it?
3817	Uh, pretty sure we're going to call it mistress.
3818	What am I going to do? My girlfriend's married.
3819	Do I ask her to get a divorce?
3820	Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage.
3821	It's like their money, or their army.
3822	Nobody takes it seriously.
3823	It's serious to me.
3824	You know what, in some countries, if you been separated
3825	for longer than five years, technically, you're no longer married.
3826	I can check it out at the law library at school.
3827	I can see my hand print on your face.
3828	Don't get too cocky, Slappy.
3829	I just got a shipment of porn from Canada I have to go through.
3830	I won the bet. Why are you still searching?
3831	Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.
3832	Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch porn.
3833	Canadian porn.
3834	Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system
3835	doesn't cover breast implants.
3836	If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian
3837	riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni
3838	I'll go out of my mind.
3839	- Hey. - Hey.
3840	Listen, dude, I got to talk to you,
3841	but you got to promise me that you won't tell Barney.
3842	Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it?
3843	- Robin's not married. - What?
3844	Why would she tell me she was?
3845	I don't know, but I cross- checked every record in Canada.
3846	There's no record of her ever being married.
3847	There must be some mistake.
3848	I promise you. She's not married.
3849	She's not great at parking legally either.
3850	So she lied to me? W--What am I going to do?
3851	I-I can't confront her, 'cause then she'll know I told you.
3852	You got to lawyer her.
3853	You got to ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up,
3854	maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes
3855	to get a confession out of her.
3856	Thanks for telling me your secret.
3857	It means so much to me, that you could be so--
3858	God, what's the word I'm looking for?
3859	Honest.
3860	Mm, thanks, Ted.
3861	Yeah.  You know what's probably the best part about your honesty?
3862	How truthful it is.
3863	I say we just move on.
3864	Well, for me to get total closure on this whole
3865	"my girlfriend has a husband" thing,
3866	I think I might need a little bit more information,
3867	like what month did you get married?
3868	June. We had a June wedding.
3869	Ah, Canada in June.
3870	That's the dream.
3871	Sit-down or buffet?
3872	Well, it's... weird that you don't remember.
3873	No, I just didn't know how to answer
3874	because we did butlered hors d'oeuvres in the atrium,
3875	but the actual dinner was a buffet in the Food Court
3876	featuring a filet mignon or a roasted potato-crusted salmon
3877	with a lobster scallion beurre blanc.
3878	Band or DJ?
3879	A string quartet played at the ceremony,
3880	but for the actual reception, we had a seven-piece band.
3881	We paid extra for the sax
3882	'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.
3883	- How many bridesmaids? - Seven.
3884	- Flowers? - Azaleas.
3885	- Color scheme? - Dusty rose and sienna.
3886	Husband's name.
3887	- You were never married! - Yes, I was.
3888	- No, you weren't. - How do you know?
3889	I looked it up at the library.
3890	- What library? - The one on Fifth.
3891	- When did you go? - Today at lunch,
3892	and I had an apple brie panini with potato salad...
3893	I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted.
3894	What database did you use?
3895	I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.
3896	Fine, Marshall looked it up at school.
3897	- You told Marshall?! - You lied to me!
3898	See, this is why I don't tell people secrets.
3899	You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most
3900	and even you couldn't keep a secret.
3901	But it was a fake secret.
3902	Yeah, I was testing you and you failed.
3903	And now you're never gonna know why I don't go to the mall.
3904	And it's good, too.
3905	You were testing me? That's insane.
3906	Oh, yeah? How long did it take for you to tell Marshall
3907	my biggest secret in the world? Five minutes?
3908	- That wasn't a real secret! - Yeah, but it could have been.
3909	You are driving me crazy!
3910	No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.
3911	He moved there for business.
3912	You.
3913	You got something to say to me?
3914	What are you talking about?
3915	I know Robin was never really married.
3916	How could you possibly know that?
3917	And then I put on my pajamas and got into bed.
3918	How about you?
3919	Oh, let's see, uh, first I took the subway to school.
3920	Then I got a bagel.
3921	Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married.
3922	Crazy.
3923	Then I was hungry again, so I went down to the vending machine,
3924	but by the time I got down there, I wasn't even hungry anymore.
3925	- You told him? - I had to.
3926	I'm Slap Bet Commissioner.
3927	Believe me, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you.
3928	Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.
3929	- Barney gets three slaps. - Three?
3930	One because you lied and two for being prematurely slapped.
3931	Three slaps.
3932	But--
3933	Oh, my God.
3934	- Are you gonna cry? - No.
3935	You're gonna cry.
3936	I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship.
3937	My parents didn't really talk to each other for 30 years
3938	and now they're divorced.
3939	I have shared more of myself with you
3940	than I've ever shared with anyone.
3941	I'm asking for this one secret,
3942	which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.
3943	So I just got a very interesting phone call.
3944	What are you talking about?
3945	I know Robin's secret.
3946	- What? - That's right.
3947	I know your secret, Robin.
3948	Or should I say Robin Sparkles?
3949	How do you know that name?
3950	Because I know the truth,
3951	and I am about to show it to you right now.
3952	Gather 'round, Ted, you're gonna want to see this.
3953	Yeah, no, I don't.
3954	What?
3955	Robin wants to keep this a secret, so...
3956	it's gonna stay a secret.
3957	Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret.
3958	You see, in my research,
3959	I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia
3960	who is in possession of a certain videotape.
3961	He just emailed me that it will be up and running
3962	on My Space in about... right now.
3963	Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down.
3964	I mean, I'm guessing.
3965	Barney, don't, okay?
3966	Robin, please don't panic.
3967	I'm only gonna show enough to prove to Marshall I was right.
3968	No, Barney, I said we're not watching this.
3969	No, it's time.
3970	Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do,
3971	but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore.
3972	Let's just watch it and be done with it.
3973	Are you as terrified as I am?
3974	I don't want to get slapped again.
3975	I want to stress that I was young.
3976	Yeah, you were.
3977	And I didn't know any better.
3978	They never do.
3979	And it started out as an innocent modeling job.
3980	It  always does.
3981	Please, Mr. Johnson.
3982	I'm sorry I was a bad girl.
3983	Please don't give me detention.
3984	Isn't there something I can do to make it up to you?
3985	Oh, my God.
3986	Well, obviously, I've been proven right,
3987	so in the interest of Robin's dignity,
3988	I won't show anymore.
3989	Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.
3990	What the hell was that?
3991	Uh, I slap bet Marshall that you did porn, so I win.
3992	Porn? I wish it was porn. It would be less embarrassing.
3993	I know.
3994	How about I sing you a song?
3995	Let's go to the mall, everybody!
3996	I was a teenage pop star in Canada.
3997	# Put on your jelly bracelets #
3998	# And your cool graffiti coat #
3999	# At the mall, having fun #
4000	# Is what it's all about #
4001	This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
4002	- That's you? - Yes.
4003	I had one minor hit.
4004	I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls.
4005	For a whole year, I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.
4006	# Everybody come and play #
4007	# Throw every last care away #
4008	# Let's go to the mall #
4009	# Today #
4010	If this is the '90s, why does it look like 1986?
4011	The '80s didn't come to Canada till, like, '93.
4012	Taking a break from the first of many, many viewings,
4013	I can't help but notice that this isn't porn.
4014	And yet, a slap occurred without the permission
4015	of the Slap Bet Commissioner.
4016	Looks like somebody suffered from premature slapulation.
4017	Oh, my God, Robin's rapping.
4018	Guys, Robin's rapping.
4019	# Went to the mall with # # a couple of friends #
4020	# I had a whole week's # # allowance to spend #
4021	Okay, I'm going to give you a choice.
4022	Either ten slaps right now in a row,
4023	or five slaps that can be doled out
4024	at any point from here to eternity.
4025	You go with the ten now.
4026	No way, why get ten when you can get five?
4027	Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment,
4028	you could get slapped in the face, would drive you crazy.
4029	I'm going to go with the five for eternity.
4030	- Good call. - Horrible call.
4031	Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man.
4032	Take it easy.
4033	This is going to be fun.
4034	# Let's go to the mall #
4035	# Let's go to the mall #
4036	# Today #
4037	So just to be clear,
4038	you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?
4039	Wow, we're going to watch this a lot.
4040	I can't believe I ever wore a Bedazzled jean jacket.
4041	Hey, just so you know,
4042	16-year-old me would have been all over you.
4043	You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had.
4044	Hey, uh, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you.
4045	I probably should have left it alone.
4046	You know what?
4047	You know me better now.
4048	That feels kind of nice.
4049	That's one.
4050	# Everybody come and play #
4051	# Throw every last care away #
4052	Wow.
4053	# Let's go to the mall #
4054	# Today #
4055	Did you have to laugh like that every time?
4056	Yes.
4057	# This boy I like #
4058	# Met him at the food court #
4059	# He's got hair like Gretzky #
4060	# And he does jumps # # on his skateboard #
4061	# I hope he asks me out #
4062	# Take me to my favorite spot #
4063	# It'll be just him and me #
4064	# But don't forget the robot #
4065	The robot. Hey!
4066	# But, baby # # I don't want to wait #
4067	# Let's do it #
4068	No, she doesn't want to wait.
4069	# I'm gonna rock # # your body anyway #
4070	# I'm gonna rock your # # body till Canada Day #
4071	# Everybody come and play #
4072	# Throw every last care away #
4073	# Let's go to the mall #
4074	# Today, today, today, today #
4075	# Let's go to the mall #
4076	# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
4077	# Let's go to the mall #
4078	# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
4079	# Let's go to the mall #
4080	# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
4081	# Let's go to the mall #
4082	# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
4083	# Let's go to the mall #
4084	# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
4085	# Let's go to the mall #
4086	# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
4087	# Today #
4088	Kids, there's nothing more wonderful
4089	than New York City in the winter...
4090	except the view of New York City in the winter
4091	through your apartment window.
4092	In the winter of 2006, Marshall, Lily, Robin and I
4093	were all deep in couple hibernation mode.
4094	Sadly, this left Uncle Barney out in the cold.
4095	Okay. All-night rave,
4096	abandoned tire factory in Newark.
4097	We're on the list. Who's in?
4098	- Nope. - No.
4099	Private jet. Teeterboro Airport, skinny-skydiving. Who's in?
4100	- Nope. - No, thanks.
4101	One beer. Bar, downstairs, 15 second walk. Who's in?
4102	Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye.
4103	It got so bad, Barney tried to be his own wingman.
4104	Hi. Have you met me?
4105	Finally, he decided to bring in reinforcements.
4106	- No. - No.
4107	Yes. And do you know why?
4108	Hang on to your bedsores, grandparents from Willy Wonka,
4109	because guess who's on his way up to this apartment right now?
4110	My... wait for it...
4111	brother, James. React.
4112	- Hey! - Hey!
4113	- You have a brother? - Yeah.
4114	He's the "awesome-est," most best "looking-est," greatest guy ever.
4115	He's exactly like Barney.
4116	That's what I just said.
4117	Well, Barney and his brother aren't exactly alike.
4118	James is gay.
4119	Really? I never in a million years
4120	would I picture you with a gay brother, that's awesome.
4121	Yeah. I just wanted you to have a heads up,
4122	so you don't act all surprised when he gets here.
4123	Here he is.
4124	What up, New York.
4125	Thanks for the heads up.
4126	How in God's name did it never come up that Barney has a gay, black brother?
4127	Is he black?
4128	I guess I'm the kind of person that focuses on who people are on the inside
4129	rather than the color of their skin.
4130	I'm kidding, I just wanted to see your face.
4131	Yeah, so now the wedding's back on.
4132	Anyway, James, how have you been?
4133	Awesome, as per "yoozh."
4134	I just went skinny-skydiving. Legendary.
4135	And my laser tag team, just made it to regional finals.
4136	"Legendarier."
4137	And by now you've noticed the suit--
4138	go 'head, touch it.
4139	Handcrafted by Pietro Dellacamera,
4140	Milan's famous 101-year-old tailor
4141	who upon completing the very last stitch
4142	in this suit dropped dead,
4143	which is ironic because that is how gorgeous I look in it.
4144	C'mon.
4145	Gimme five.
4146	Is "gimme five" back?
4147	Oh, yeah. I put it in my blog this morning.
4148	Guys, "gimme five" is back!
4149	Oh, James, this is my girlfriend, Robin.
4150	- Hey. It's so nice to meet you. - You, too.
4151	So, I have to ask, there's a story here.
4152	Please.
4153	The truth is, Barney and James got a lot of...
4154	different explanations from their mom over the years.
4155	Well, boys, you look different
4156	because when I was pregnant with you,
4157	I only ate vanilla ice cream.
4158	And when I was pregnant with you,
4159	can you guess what kind of ice cream I ate?
4160	- Coffee? - No, James,
4161	I ate chocolate ice cream.
4162	But I did drink tons of coffee when I was pregnant with both of you.
4163	Can't smoke without my coffee.
4164	I don't know, boys, I guess it's just one of those things.
4165	Stop asking me!
4166	You  know what you two are? You're little racists!
4167	So what are you guys gonna do tonight?
4168	I'll tell you what James is gonna do.
4169	He's gonna do the job you've been neglecting.
4170	And, as always, he'll do it a lot better than you ever did.
4171	Ted...
4172	James is my wingman now.
4173	Okay.
4174	Last time James was in town, Barney got slapped once,
4175	lucky twice, and...
4176	whose penthouse hot tub did you end up in?
4177	Ah, public figure, confidentiality agreement.
4178	But I will say this:
4179	way more back hair than any guy
4180	who can afford laser hair removal should have.
4181	And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo.
4182	It was everything we ever dreamed of
4183	when watching Donnie and Marie.
4184	She was a little bit country.
4185	He was a little bit way into black guys.
4186	Yeah, Barney and James together was a lethal combination.
4187	Since there was never any crossover in targets,
4188	James was always there for Barney with the assist.
4189	Whoa. Your scarf...
4190	it is fierce!
4191	Thanks. H & M.
4192	What? I would never know,
4193	'cause it is so hot that my eyes are melting. Oh, I can't see.
4194	Hey! You know, speaking of things
4195	that would look good wrapped around you,
4196	have you met my straight brother, Barney?
4197	Oh, he is fab-- don't you go nowhere-- "ulous." Okay?
4198	And Barney always returned the favor.
4199	Help, I don't think he's breathing.
4200	Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth?
4201	Oh, my God, I do!
4202	Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?
4203	Oh, man, I am so excited that you're here!
4204	It has been forever since I have been around anyone
4205	even remotely fun.
4206	Uh, yes offense.
4207	You guys are still going out with us tonight, right?
4208	- No. - Jammies.
4209	Tonight? It's after 9:00 and...
4210	I have warm soup belly.
4211	Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys...
4212	you are young, attractive people here
4213	in the greatest city on earth.
4214	There  are boys and girls
4215	in Nobody Cares, Wyoming, wishing they could be here.
4216	But instead, they are in someone's basement drinking bad malt liquor,
4217	debating whether or not they're going to spend their Saturday night
4218	in  the parking lot of the feed store
4219	or in some other dude's basement.
4220	You owe it to them to rise up
4221	and shimmy your lazy asses into something hot,
4222	and you go out there and you live their dream!
4223	- Can I get a "hell, yeah"? - Hell, yeah!
4224	- Can I get a "hell, yeah"? - Hell, yeah!
4225	- Can I get a "woo-woo"? - Woo-woo!
4226	Go do it for Wyoming! Yes!
4227	Testify!
4228	So that night, Barney got his wish.
4229	We all went out.
4230	Daddy's home!
4231	Yeah.
4232	All right, bro. What do you like?
4233	Guy in super tight black T?
4234	Super tight black guy?
4235	Guy who looks like Mr. T?
4236	Mmm, yes, yes, and... talk to me after two martinis.
4237	Let's focus on you, my man.
4238	I'm feeling lazy.
4239	How 'bout girl with the chocolatini?
4240	Oh... boom, back tattoo.
4241	Hero and the pig?
4242	- Let's ride. - Fo' 'sho.
4243	Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!
4244	- Get off me, you pig! - Hey! Hey!
4245	Her body art is not an invitation to grope her,
4246	it's an expression of her inner self.
4247	I'm sure, in many ways, she is the dolphin encircled by flowers.
4248	- What? What? - What? What?
4249	Cool.
4250	Let me know if he bothers you again.
4251	Thanks. You should stay close... just in case.
4252	Sure. If it'll make you feel safer.
4253	I'm Barney.
4254	Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy, crowded bar,
4255	you can always tell the difference between the singles
4256	and the couples.
4257	You just have to look for the signs.
4258	- Break. - Boiling hot.
4259	Singles stay on their feet for maneuverability.
4260	- Hey! - Hi, how are ya?
4261	Have you met my brother?
4262	Oh, hello. Have a drink.
4263	Nice to meet ya.
4264	Couples, exhausted by the sheer act of leaving the house,
4265	are obsessed with finding a place to sit down.
4266	There are a lot of other indicators, too.
4267	From choice of social lubricant...
4268	...to basic body language.
4269	But the point is, there are many ways to tell
4270	whether someone has Single Stamina
4271	or Couples Coma.
4272	I wish I would've worn sneakers.
4273	I just got finished running from some fat, hairy guy
4274	who was periscoping out of his pleather pants.
4275	Permission to come aboard denied.
4276	I miss my jammies.
4277	I can't believe I wore a bra for this.
4278	Bras suck. They're so confining and unnatural.
4279	Yeah, they're like a boobie zoo.
4280	Well, why don't you take it off then and let those puppies breathe?
4281	Oh, please go sweat on someone else.
4282	Poor guy.
4283	Poor guy? Poor my boobs.
4284	Well, it takes a lot of guts to approach a girl
4285	and you just crushed him.
4286	Oh, yeah, yeah. He looks all broken up inside.
4287	Whatever, you guys have no idea what it's like
4288	to be on the receiving end.
4289	"Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl
4290	and everybody everywhere wants to buy me drinks
4291	and have sex with me."
4292	Waa.
4293	"Oh, poor me. I get to order yummy, pink drinks
4294	with chunks of real fruit that guys secretly like,
4295	but  can't order because they'll be made fun of."
4296	- Dude. - They're delicious!
4297	Excuse me. Join me in a shot?
4298	Oh, no thanks. I've had enough.
4299	He's too in shape,
4300	we'd spend all night talking about his body fat content.
4301	Now, if you'll excuse me,
4302	I'm gonna go have a yummy, pink drink with fruit in it...
4303	because I can.
4304	You know, that was, like, the third hot guy
4305	that James blew off tonight.
4306	Yeah, he's turning down shots, he's yawning,
4307	he's whining about his feet.
4308	He's as bad as we are.
4309	He is.
4310	Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are. You guys don't think that James is...
4311	in a relationship?
4312	No. There's no way. He's Barney's brother.
4313	Look at that.
4314	He's texting!
4315	Oh, my God!
4316	He is in a couple.
4317	This is gonna kill Barney.
4318	What's gonna kill me?
4319	What's going on?
4320	B-Barney?
4321	Have you noticed anything... different about James?
4322	No.
4323	I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean.
4324	We have reason to believe that James is, uh,
4325	maybe hiding something from you.
4326	I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but...
4327	Barney...
4328	your brother is...
4329	monogamous.
4330	That's ridiculous!
4331	Just because he's a little sleepy,
4332	and he hasn't had sex with anyone in a bathroom stall...
4333	He hasn't had sex with anyone in a bathroom stall.
4334	And, Barney...
4335	I hate to be the one to tell you this, but...
4336	he's texting.
4337	No, he... No!
4338	That... is impossible.
4339	Excuse... Excuse... Ex...
4340	Hey, bro.
4341	Don't change the subject.
4342	Let me see your phone.
4343	Why?
4344	I just want to see your phone. Let me see your phone.
4345	No, it's just a phone. It's just a phone!
4346	And it's got Internet access, and it's got a camera on it,
4347	and you can surf the Web and do the whole thing.
4348	It's so amazing how far technology has come.
4349	What kind of phone do you have?
4350	I got...
4351	Who is this?
4352	And the answer better be: "I don't remember his name."
4353	That is Tom.
4354	And he's my fiancé.
4355	Hey.
4356	I don't support this.
4357	Gay marriage?
4358	Not gay marriage-- marriage!
4359	How can you do this?
4360	We  were raised in the same house, with the same values!
4361	Believe me, I fought this for a long time.
4362	Come on, it's embarrassing.
4363	Look, this felt unnatural to me, too, at first.
4364	But I fell in love.
4365	And Tom and I realized you can't fight love.
4366	Oh, God.
4367	Is that what you two do together? You sit around the house
4368	and talk about love? I think... I'm gonna be sick.
4369	Okay, okay, look,
4370	I need you to wrap your head around this, okay?
4371	Because it is happening.
4372	And I want you to be my best man.
4373	What? No way.
4374	Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
4375	I hope you change your mind.
4376	Two beers, one shot.
4377	Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.
4378	Oh, sweetie! Did you make that for me?
4379	Yes.
4380	Clam Bake. Staten Island. Who's in?
4381	Okay, I didn't have high hopes for that one.
4382	Okay, here's my thing.
4383	If gay guys start getting married,
4384	then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it.
4385	That's how it works. They start something,
4386	then six months later, everyone follows.
4387	Like now everyone gets manicures.
4388	I don't get manicures.
4389	Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed.
4390	You get your chest waxed?
4391	You know what I mean!
4392	Gay marriage is going to cause single life,
4393	as we know it, to die out.
4394	Think of how the American family will be strengthened.
4395	Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up
4396	and be a man about this.
4397	No.
4398	It's always been me and him together, being awesome,
4399	while the rest of you walked two-by-two
4400	onto your ark of sexless boredom.
4401	Just because James is getting married
4402	doesn't mean things are going to change.
4403	Yeah. Like things haven't changed with you people.
4404	Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like.
4405	Sandals and socks-- come on, buddy.
4406	But I took her out, we celebrated.
4407	It was the right thing to do.
4408	You got to support him.
4409	You're right, Ted.
4410	This is a cause for celebration.
4411	We need to take him out and celebrate the commitment
4412	he and Tom are about to make.
4413	Yeah. This is where we're celebrating
4414	the commitment that Tom and I are about to make?
4415	What? Yeah!
4416	See, that cage represents your commitment.
4417	Oh, my God. Freedom has never tasted so delicious.
4418	Hey.
4419	You work out?
4420	I do.
4421	And thank you for noticing.
4422	You're obviously in very good shape yourself.
4423	Well, I try.
4424	So you want to dance?
4425	You know what? I'm very flattered, and, objectively,
4426	you're a very attractive man, but this is actually my fiancée.
4427	I'm sorry. You know, I saw your drink and I...
4428	No, no, this isn't my drink. This is hers.
4429	No, it isn't.
4430	Whatever.
4431	How 'bout you?
4432	Oh, I'm straight, too.
4433	But I thank you for your time,
4434	and I appreciate your interest in my body.
4435	You see that?
4436	Being hit on doesn't have to be terrible.
4437	I feel flattered, and everyone left with their dignity.
4438	Hey, I really like your sweater.
4439	Wow. You actually do, don't you?
4440	You're not checking out my boobs or anything.
4441	My name's Gay Ken, what do you think?
4442	I love this place! Let's dance!
4443	- And not be groped! - Whoo! Thank you.
4444	- Damn. - Thank you!
4445	- We're hot. - Totally.
4446	And then Tom says to the dealer
4447	that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner.
4448	Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?!
4449	Bam!
4450	Sounds like you really rocked that arts and crafts fair.
4451	Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
4452	Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating,
4453	being able to talk about this to you.
4454	I cannot wait for you to meet Tom.
4455	And I cannot wait for you to meet my good friend...
4456	this guy.
4457	Excuse me, do you know anyone who would like to buy
4458	my incredibly muscular, fun, large-handed brother a drink?
4459	Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay.
4460	All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down
4461	because they are in a gay club.
4462	You see that chick right there?
4463	She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player.
4464	Okay, I'm in.
4465	Which one am I?
4466	Please.
4467	He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil, and drops his pants
4468	after three dirty martinis. Now go, man, go!
4469	I just never thought I'd see Barney so vulnerable.
4470	Well, I guess no one wants to feel like they're going through the world alone.
4471	Look at me, in a yummy sandwich!
4472	Okay, we're actually right in the middle of something right now, so...
4473	Ooh, I know what I want to be in the middle of. Thoughts?
4474	God, can't two straight guys come to a gay dance club,
4475	enjoy some techno and good conversation without being bothered?
4476	How's it going, guys? Still enjoying the attentions of men?
4477	That's like the eighth guy who's hit on us in ten minutes.
4478	It's like, hello, my eyes are up here.
4479	And  it's never the hot ones.
4480	It's always the losers. Bums me out!
4481	Looks like the boys learned their lesson.
4482	Do you totally miss being hit on?
4483	Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar.
4484	James, James, since you like arts and crafts,
4485	look at what Charles here made with cherry stems.
4486	He did it with his tongue.
4487	Yeah.
4488	Barney.
4489	So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone,
4490	and once he's in a funner mood...
4491	Barney, Barney, I don't want his number.
4492	I don't want anyone's number, okay?
4493	I'm getting married.
4494	Wow.
4495	- Best of luck to you both. - Thank you.
4496	My number's in here.
4497	I'm very discreet.
4498	Okay, okay, excuse me.
4499	Barney, family talk.
4500	Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay?
4501	I know that my getting married is threatening to your way of life...
4502	Oh, so now it's my way of life?
4503	I thought it was our way of life.
4504	You've completely turned your back on it.
4505	Look at you, not even suited up.
4506	Do you remember why we suit up, James?
4507	To get laid.
4508	To show people that we are different
4509	from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there.
4510	The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with,
4511	a two-person army that plays by its own rules.
4512	But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines,
4513	and you've abandoned me.
4514	Well, I'm not gonna let you do that.
4515	It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing!
4516	You don't have to do this, bro!
4517	- Yes, I do. - Why?!
4518	Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby.
4519	What? There's gonna be a baby?
4520	Yes. We're adopting.
4521	Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?
4522	For the rest of your life.
4523	And that's how Barney became Uncle Barney.
4524	A year later, at James's wedding,
4525	Barney could not have been more proud.
4526	To James and Tom.
4527	May you have a long and happy life together.
4528	And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.
4529	- Cheers. - Cheers.
4530	Nice one.
4531	Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase.
4532	No one wants to hear about that.
4533	It was perfect.
4534	You even made Tom's dad cry.
4535	Might have been doing that because he's a Republican.
4536	Whoa.
4537	It's 9:00.
4538	We should be getting back. You guys want to split a cab?
4539	Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.
4540	Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all.
4541	All right, well, it's getting late. Got to get the wife home.
4542	Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat.
4543	Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.
4544	- May I? - Yeah.
4545	Hey, buddy.
4546	Your parents are married.
4547	Now, listen, you.
4548	Just because you're being raised by married people
4549	doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle.
4550	High-five.
4551	Luckily, you got me.
4552	In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21,
4553	and I will be...
4554	Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet.
4555	But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style.
4556	Stick with me, kid.
4557	I am gonna teach you how to live.
4558	Great suit, by the way.
4559	Who is the cutest?
4560	I don't get it.
4561	Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade.
4562	Why doesn't he like them now?
4563	Why?
4564	Rosa, why always be attracted to the unavailable ones?
4565	Why not accept the fact that you're a beautiful woman
4566	who is worthy of love?
4567	Are you brave enough to hear that?
4568	You...
4569	Kids, as you know, Christmas is a time you spend with your family.
4570	So in December of 2006, I had three options.
4571	Spend it with my mom and her new boyfriend Clint,
4572	spend it with my dad and his new girlfriend micro-brewing,
4573	or head down to Staten Island to spend it
4574	with my super religious cousin Stacy and her family.
4575	So I opted for none of the above
4576	and decided to spend Christmas 2006 in Manhattan...
4577	celebrating with my other family.
4578	Okay, I have one last paper due at 5:00 p.m. today,
4579	so until then, I will be at the law library at school,
4580	but I'm not to be disturbed for any reason.
4581	Dude, open your eyes. You're going to hurt yourself.
4582	No, no. Christmas Eve winter wonderland is my reward
4583	for finishing my paper.
4584	Baby, do I smell your Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?
4585	Yes.
4586	Damn me and my heightened other senses.
4587	Must be strong.
4588	Okay, I'll be back here at 5:00.
4589	Save me at least 20 cookies and do not clean the bowl.
4590	Was that a reindeer?
4591	I don't want to know!
4592	Hey, look. Our old answering machine.
4593	Oh, yeah. After you left, we, uh, we unplugged it
4594	because it reminded Marshall of how you used to, you know, leave messages.
4595	But hey, you guys are back together.
4596	I say we're plugging it back in.
4597	It's good to have you back.
4598	Thanks.
4599	Oh, hey, look, there's still some messages on here.
4600	Hey Ted, it's Dad calling to check in.
4601	I'm going fishing this weekend with my friend Clint,
4602	so if I don't hear from you beforehand, I'll talk to you next week.
4603	Yes, same Clint.
4604	Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the couch right now moping about Lily?
4605	You are, aren't you?
4606	Well, stop it. She's not worth it.
4607	You gotta get over that Grinch.
4608	But I didn't say "Grinch."
4609	I said a bad word.
4610	A very, very bad word.
4611	Oh, fudge.
4612	But I didn't say fudge.
4613	I'm... a what?
4614	I-- That was Barney, that was Barney.
4615	- That was you, Ted. - That was Marshall.
4616	Marshall left a message for Marshall?
4617	You know, it may have been me, but it was so long ago.
4618	Man, that machine, it really garbles your voice.
4619	You know, it almost made it sound like I said...
4620	Why would you call me that?
4621	It was a fair question.
4622	Marshall's breakup with Lily had sent him into a deep depression
4623	and nothing could get him out of it.
4624	Until one day...
4625	She was perfect.
4626	I lost the perfect woman.
4627	I should have knocked her up when I had the chance.
4628	Okay. That's it.
4629	You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal.
4630	So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Lily.
4631	There's only one of her?
4632	Okay.
4633	She called off your wedding
4634	and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco.
4635	What do you call that?
4636	Fiercely independent?
4637	Brave?
4638	I guess it was a little selfish.
4639	There you go.
4640	And in almost no time, that spark turned into a roaring fire.
4641	Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything.
4642	She'd give it up for a bad pun.
4643	I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut.
4644	Remember that time we heard her laughing
4645	and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's,
4646	but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?
4647	And  her art?
4648	"I'm Lily, I'm an artist."
4649	She doesn't even own a beret.
4650	Yeah, and if she's such a great "artist,"
4651	why does she suck at Pictionary?
4652	Who draws a ninja star like a Star of David? Right, right?
4653	Yeah!
4654	- Another round! - Yeah!
4655	I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend.
4656	That's the best friend's job.
4657	The best friend's job is to call me that word?
4658	Yeah.
4659	Oh, Ted.
4660	Oh, Teddy boy.
4661	Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word.
4662	We use lots of words, every day.
4663	It shouldn't be any different than any other word.
4664	Then why don't you say it now?
4665	Grinch.
4666	You timed that didn't you?
4667	Perfectly.
4668	Well, at least you apologized.
4669	You apologized, didn't you?
4670	Oh, yeah.
4671	"I'm sorry" were the first words out of my mouth.
4672	I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing.
4673	I was just trying to put the guy back together.
4674	You smashed him to pieces.
4675	Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message?
4676	- No! - Why not?
4677	Because, Lily, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch.
4678	- Oooh. - Oooh.
4679	Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby.
4680	Ted Vivian Mosby!
4681	That's not my middle name.
4682	You kiss your mother with that mouth?
4683	Like you've never said that word.
4684	I don't kiss your mother with my mouth.
4685	Yet.
4686	Are you sick?
4687	Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?
4688	No, I meant do you have a cold?
4689	I'm fine.
4690	I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome
4691	and I had to get some of it out.
4692	Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time
4693	when people are lonely and desperate.
4694	It's the most wonderful time of the year.
4695	I  should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve.
4696	Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses?
4697	If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays.
4698	I don't see any mistletoe, but...
4699	Oh!  Oh, God!
4700	Uh... "Bless you" would have been nice.
4701	- You're sick. - I'm not sick.
4702	- You're sick. - You know what? I am sick.
4703	Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up?
4704	Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled.
4705	Hey, buddy.
4706	You sure this is gonna work?
4707	Yeah, this is our thing.
4708	In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer.
4709	- Cute, right? - Totally.
4710	Plus free mug.
4711	Okay, come on.
4712	Usually that would've done the trick,
4713	but it turned out this was a problem not even alcohol could solve.
4714	Actually the beer helped a little.
4715	She took the decorations.
4716	She took the decorations!
4717	What a Grinch!
4718	That time I did say "Grinch."
4719	All right.
4720	I guess I have to call her, right?
4721	Lily's cell phone.
4722	She'll listen to reason-- right?
4723	Oh, hey, Billy.
4724	Actually, funny thing-- the voice dial got you.
4725	I was trying to call...
4726	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
4727	Yeah, the holidays are a rough time for everyone, Billy.
4728	Okay, yeah, dinner next Wednesday.
4729	Okay.
4730	Damn voice dial.
4731	Barney! What the hell are you doing?
4732	Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane?
4733	Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive "no cigars in the apartment rule."
4734	God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban.
4735	High five.
4736	Eww. No.
4737	You have to go home and get to bed.
4738	Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north,
4739	let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body.
4740	You see, whenever I start feeling sick,
4741	I just stop being sick and be awesome instead.
4742	True story.
4743	Yeah, in two minutes,
4744	I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab,
4745	play a couple of hours of laser tag,
4746	maybe get a spray-on tan.
4747	It's gonna be legen...
4748	Wait for it...
4749	Lily!
4750	Merry Christmas, assface.
4751	Um, Lily? Where are the Christmas decorations?
4752	At my apartment.
4753	You want to bring them back so we can celebrate Christmas together-- please?
4754	Ted, do you know what I would do
4755	if one of my kindergartners used that kind of language?
4756	I would be on the phone with their parents.
4757	Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.
4758	Exactly. You know what that word means.
4759	You know that calling people names is mean and hurtful...
4760	assface.
4761	Lily, if you don't bring that stuff back right now, we...
4762	She hung up.
4763	She's just mad. She'll cool down.
4764	Lily...
4765	Don't forget to take the cookies out of the oven...
4766	assface!
4767	Damn it!
4768	I could be in Cleveland right now making peppermint lager with my dad.
4769	Where are you going?
4770	Marshall gets home in three hours.
4771	He's gonna show up-- no Lily, no winter wonderland.
4772	I gotta get up to the Bronx.
4773	...dary.
4774	Hey, dude, how's the paper going?
4775	Screw the paper, how's the winter wonderland? Is it magical?
4776	Oh...  so magical.
4777	When you walk through the door, does it feel like
4778	you've been slapped in the face by Christmas?
4779	Sure does. Look, I gotta go.
4780	Come on, man, describe it! Tell me about the decorations.
4781	Is Rudolph there? He is, isn't he?
4782	Hi, Rudolph!
4783	Ah, yeah, but, you know...
4784	decorations, is that really what Christmas is about?
4785	Hell, yeah! What else would it be about?
4786	Uh, try the birth of Christ.
4787	You know, Christmas-- Christ Mas,
4788	which means "More Christ" to our Spanish friends.
4789	Yeah, well, all I know is walking in that door
4790	and seeing the winter wonderland and seeing Lily and all you guys,
4791	just... I can't wait.
4792	Right. I gotta go.
4793	Right. Okay.
4794	Oh, wait. Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted. One more thing.
4795	How about the cookies? Are they delicious?
4796	You know, honestly, they taste a little store-bought.
4797	Oh! I got another call.
4798	Well, tell Lily I love her.
4799	Right.
4800	- Hello? - Ted Evelyn Mosby!
4801	Oh. Uh, hey, Mom. Merry Christmas.
4802	I just got the most disturbing call from Lily.
4803	How could you use such a horrible word?
4804	Oh, God, she called you?
4805	Are you acting out because of the divorce?
4806	Is-is this all about Clint?
4807	No, Mom, why would it be about Clint?
4808	Hey, buddy, it's Clint. How you doing, champ?
4809	Hey, Clint. Listen, um, I don't really have time to...
4810	Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted.
4811	You don't know this yet,
4812	but you and I are going to be great friends.
4813	Now, the Native Americans have this ritual...
4814	This is a low moment for the Barnacle.
4815	I should be off playing laser tag right now,
4816	but instead...
4817	Don't look at me. I'm hideous.
4818	You just look like a regular guy.
4819	Exactly.
4820	I'm a Ted. I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants.
4821	And isn't it more comfy?
4822	Yes.
4823	Come on, you need eat something.
4824	Too weak... to hold... bowl.
4825	Fine, I'll feed you.
4826	Ouchie in my mouth!
4827	I don't want it. I want ice cream.
4828	No, you're not having ice cream for dinner just 'cause you're sick.
4829	- But my throat hurts. - No.
4830	I hate you!
4831	Don't leave me.
4832	Who is it?
4833	Pizza delivery.
4834	Whoa.
4835	Hey, you tricked me.
4836	You really thought I was the pizza delivery guy?
4837	No, I knew it was you.
4838	I just thought you'd at least bring a pizza.
4839	Yeah, well,
4840	I brought a beer, but I gave it to a homeless guy.
4841	All  right, he took it from me.
4842	Now, will you please come home?
4843	No, I'm not spending Christmas with you.
4844	Okay, I'm sorry for calling you a...
4845	that word,
4846	over the summer,
4847	and for saying it again today.
4848	And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over.
4849	I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.
4850	Oh, shut up.
4851	You think I don't know your fake apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh?
4852	You're clearly still mad at me.
4853	- I'm not mad at you. - Yes, you are.
4854	I am not mad at you, Lily. Now, can we please just...
4855	I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me
4856	and we've moved passed it. Why can't you?
4857	Because you never apologized to me.
4858	Marshall's not the only one you walked out on.
4859	You leave for three months, you don't even call.
4860	Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends!
4861	Yeah, some friend, you called me a Grinch.
4862	- You were a Grinch! - How can you...
4863	Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.
4864	Happy?
4865	Now, you've pissed off the big guy upstairs.
4866	Yeah, I'm sure God cares if I...
4867	You use that language again and I'll turn off your water!
4868	That's my super. He lives above me.
4869	Great. Thanks to your filthy mouth,
4870	now I'm going to have Christmas alone in the dark.
4871	Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas.
4872	You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there
4873	I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy.
4874	Just....
4875	Ow.
4876	Merry Christmas.
4877	You're spending Christmas Eve with your family?
4878	Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.
4879	Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird.
4880	You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees.
4881	And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name
4882	when he wants to trick us.
4883	Well, do you want me to go with you?
4884	Was that a sincere offer?
4885	First tell me your answer.
4886	Stay there. Save yourself.
4887	We'll spend all day together tomorrow.
4888	Okay.
4889	Oh, how's Barney feeling?
4890	You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness?
4891	He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine.
4892	You're gonna be a great mom.
4893	Holy crap, the magical Christmas season is upon us.
4894	And thank God we don't pay for utilities.
4895	Merry Christmas!
4896	What's in the box?
4897	Only the best present for the best girl ever.
4898	It took me all day to track it down.
4899	I thought you were writing a paper.
4900	Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension.
4901	School's not important.
4902	What is that pitter patter on the roof?
4903	Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story
4904	about to come down the chimney?
4905	Why, yes, it is.
4906	'Twas the day before Christmas...
4907	It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago,
4908	but then it got lost and rerouted.
4909	I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here.
4910	Yeah, all I needed to know was the tracking number.
4911	Looks like it's headed out to our regional branch in Poughkeepsie.
4912	What?
4913	No, no, no, no, I need that package today.
4914	Listen, the truck already left five minutes ago,
4915	so unless you want to run after it...
4916	Stop! Stop!
4917	Stop, please, stop.
4918	Stop. Stop the truck.
4919	I need a package on your truck. Can I please take a look in back?
4920	Sure. But I gotta keep driving my route.
4921	I'm running behind.
4922	My bad.
4923	I'm okay.
4924	Hey, man, thanks for helping me make my fiancée's Christmas.
4925	No problem.
4926	Too bad I can't deliver all these packages by the end of the day.
4927	Wait, so some people aren't going to get their gifts in time for Christmas?
4928	Sadly, no.
4929	# They call me back door Santa #
4930	# I make my runs # # about the break of day #
4931	# They call me back door Santa #
4932	# I make my runs # # about the break of day #
4933	# Oh, ho, ho #
4934	# I make all # # the little girls happy... #
4935	We delivered every single package on that truck.
4936	But I still have one package left to give.
4937	Yeah, I did.
4938	Merry Christmas.
4939	- Open it, Baby. - Okay.
4940	Oh, my God.
4941	An Easy Bake Oven!
4942	I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl.
4943	In this exact model.
4944	I never told you that. How did you know?
4945	It's our first Christmas since we got back together.
4946	I want to get her something really special.
4947	So I'm getting her a jukebox.
4948	Wow, that's a great gift.
4949	Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum.
4950	Oh, man, I know something you could get her
4951	that would blow her mind.
4952	Ready?
4953	Eight years ago...
4954	When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven.
4955	I begged and I begged,
4956	but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom
4957	didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles.
4958	Easy Bake Oven-- that's what I'm going to call my van.
4959	Dude... how was the concert?
4960	I  couldn't find the outside.
4961	I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years.
4962	Yeah, and after all that weed.
4963	Where is he anyway?
4964	Staten Island.
4965	Why?
4966	Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents.
4967	Like the gift of God's love?
4968	No, dude, real presents.
4969	Uncle Ted got us presents!
4970	That's okay, Ted, we'll just give them to charity.
4971	Yay!
4972	Uh, not you, Charity.
4973	I meant the less fortunate.
4974	Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight?
4975	Uh, you know what, why don't you say it.
4976	I really wouldn't know what to say.
4977	Why don't you recite your favorite passage of scripture.
4978	That's a great idea, Charity.
4979	But, really, I don't know.
4980	I mean how do you choose your favorite passage?
4981	It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones...
4982	That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool.
4983	Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.
4984	Dear, Father, thank you for this day,
4985	and thank you for bringing this family together.
4986	Amen.
4987	Who is it, Ted?
4988	Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers.
4989	# Silent night #
4990	# Holy night... #
4991	I came here to apologize.
4992	I'm so sorry, Ted.
4993	I accept. Give me the beer.
4994	Oh, oh, it is so good to see you guys.
4995	Are you coming home?
4996	Totally.
4997	But first, Lily, I owe you an apology.
4998	Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am?
4999	Yes!
5000	Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving?
5001	Yes.
5002	And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again.
5003	That's okay.
5004	I was kind of a Grinch.
5005	What's a Grinch?
5006	Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say.
5007	Mom, what's a Grinch?
5008	Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...
5009	Merry Christmas, everybody.
5010	Run, run.
5011	Merry Christmas, Marshall.
5012	Kids, you remember my first day with Robin.
5013	- I think I'm in love with you. - What?!
5014	Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad,
5015	usually take longer to say "I love you."
5016	Robin went through the usual stages.
5017	- Spider! Spider! - I left something in the hallway.
5018	- Where? - Right there.
5019	Got it.
5020	First there's the moment when you think you think it.
5021	Whoa, still alive.
5022	There's the moment you think you know it.
5023	Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick.
5024	Totally worth it.
5025	There's the moment where you know you know it,  but you can't yet say it.
5026	All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow?
5027	Good night.
5028	Good night.
5029	Wait, Ted?
5030	Yeah?
5031	Good night.
5032	Well, great, I'll see you then.
5033	Bye, sweetie.
5034	Hey. Guess what?
5035	My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend.
5036	She gets in on Thursday.
5037	That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do?
5038	I'm going to take off work Friday.
5039	We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.
5040	Really? You'd do that?
5041	Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.
5042	And then there's the moment where you know you know it,
5043	and you can't keep it in any longer.
5044	- Ted. - Yeah?
5045	Falafel.
5046	- Falafel? - Falafel.
5047	Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said "falafel"?
5048	- I totally choked. - I just don't get it.
5049	Why can't you tell Ted you love him?
5050	Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.
5051	Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before.
5052	No.
5053	Okay, well, I don't usually get this far in the relationship.
5054	I usually take the three-week exit.
5055	Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.
5056	Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge.
5057	Relationships are like a freeway.
5058	Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.
5059	No, this is new. This trumps that.
5060	Freeways have exits. So do relationships.
5061	The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in.
5062	You meet, you talk, you have sex, you exit when she's in the shower.
5063	So every girl you have sex with feels the immediate need to shower?
5064	Actually, yeah, I get that.
5065	The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--
5066	that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars.
5067	What?
5068	Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death.
5069	Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life,
5070	it's like, "Are we there yet?"
5071	So I've never been on the freeway this long before.
5072	I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing
5073	that makes me want to take the next exit.
5074	Yeah, been there.
5075	I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing.
5076	Okay, it was Marshall.
5077	It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.
5078	Relax, it'll happen when it happens.
5079	Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.
5080	Oh, here comes Katie.
5081	- Aw, your sister's so cute. - Yeah.
5082	This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school,
5083	with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack.
5084	- Hello, Kitty. - Oh, no.
5085	No. No. No.
5086	- Hey, Robin. How are you? - Oh, good. Good.
5087	So, who is this... tongue person?
5088	Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.
5089	Looks like hotness runs in the family.
5090	Oh,  you said that. Great.
5091	So how long have you two been...?
5092	- Two whole months. - Yeah.
5093	He's actually coming to visit family in New York, too.
5094	Isn't that great?
5095	My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so...
5096	That's cool. This is my friend Lily.
5097	Hot.
5098	You say things!
5099	Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled.
5100	Um, actually, I'm going to stay with Kyle tonight.
5101	- Uh, no, you're not. - Oh, come on.
5102	It's kind of a special night.
5103	If you know what I mean.
5104	What?
5105	Oh. Oh...
5106	I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a...
5107	...douche with a faux hawk.
5108	This can't happen.
5109	You guys have to help me talk her out of it.
5110	Speech to talk a girl out of having sex.
5111	Yeah, I don't have any of those.
5112	Discouraging premarital sex is against my religion.
5113	Please? I'm her older sister.
5114	I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.
5115	It's 2:00 and you've already had three scotch and sodas.
5116	That's why I need your help.
5117	Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night.
5118	And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building.
5119	You guys are lucky you came here with an architect.
5120	Empire State Building fun fact number one:
5121	When construction began on March 17, 1930,
5122	the framework rose at a rate of four and a half stories per week.
5123	Four and a half stories per week.
5124	Four and a half stories per week.
5125	There it is. There it is. Come on.
5126	These are fun facts, guys, let's have fun with them.
5127	You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long,
5128	but I waited to come here with someone special.
5129	Oh, here we go.
5130	Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either.
5131	But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancé.
5132	Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school.
5133	It's totally cool to wait.
5134	And stay away from drugs... other than pot.
5135	- You told them? - Oh, okay, yes, I told them.
5136	But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too.
5137	Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?
5138	-  Totally. You should wait. - Sex is fun.
5139	See?
5140	You are such a hypocrite. You were only 16 when you lost yours.
5141	Well, how do you know that?
5142	You  left your diary in your old room slash my new room.
5143	I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.
5144	Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now.
5145	It's like forever.
5146	I mean, we've already done everything else.
5147	- I mean, we've even... - Oh. La, la, la, la, la.
5148	La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
5149	Even Kyle gets to do that.
5150	You have no right to tell me not to do it.
5151	But Kyle? Why can't you just wait?
5152	Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted.
5153	Robin, this is happening.
5154	Look, I already put it up on my Myspace page.
5155	- I need a clove. - You smoke now, too?
5156	- Oh, remember cloves? - No!
5157	No "Aw, remember cloves?" This can't happen.
5158	She's my baby sister, okay?
5159	She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having sex.
5160	Come on, you were only 16 when you had sex.
5161	- I was 17. - We were 18.
5162	Barney was probably 12.
5163	Good one, Ted.
5164	I was, uh, six... fourt...
5165	How old were you again?
5166	- 17. - Dude, me, too.
5167	- Barney, you okay? - Yeah, of course.
5168	What, you don't believe me?
5169	- It was at camp, so I'm... - What camp?
5170	This place in the Catskills. Look it up.
5171	I was there teaching for the summer.
5172	What did you teach?
5173	Uh, dance.
5174	Dance?
5175	Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it.
5176	It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more.
5177	Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.
5178	# Sylvia #
5179	# Yes, Mickey? #
5180	# How you call your loverboy? #
5181	# Come here, loverboy #
5182	# And if he doesn't answer #
5183	# Oh, loverboy #
5184	# And if he still doesn't answer? #
5185	# I simply say, baby... #
5186	# Oh, baby #
5187	# My sweet baby #
5188	That's Dirty Dancing.
5189	- It was on last night. - No, it was two nights ago.
5190	"She's Like the Wind" has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours.
5191	I just got it out. Now it's back in.
5192	Damn you, Swayze!
5193	- Do you remember our first time? - Yeah.
5194	It was back in college.
5195	Oh, wait, wait.
5196	Look... I really want to do this, but...
5197	we should make it special, you know?
5198	Do this right.
5199	Okay.
5200	You're right.
5201	Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend.
5202	Yeah, New Year's Eve.
5203	Okay.
5204	Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music.
5205	That's not a good idea.
5206	Why not?
5207	Long story.
5208	But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together.
5209	Oh, yeah, that sounds so good.
5210	Oh, I love you, Marshall.
5211	I'm so glad we're waiting.
5212	Oops.
5213	- Oh, that's adorable. - Yeah, tell her what happened next.
5214	- That was amazing. - Yeah.
5215	Want to do it again?
5216	Please don't.
5217	- We said we were sorry. - Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?
5218	You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.
5219	The  point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.
5220	Well, mine was terrible.
5221	Wait, I've never heard your story.
5222	Well, as you know, I was 16.
5223	And it was with my boyfriend Brian.
5224	- Ready? - Yeah.
5225	- This feels so right. - Oh, I know.
5226	- Oh, Robin. - Oh, Brian.
5227	Yeah, I'm gay.
5228	- I'm so sorry. - Eh, I should've known.
5229	There were signs.
5230	Oh, my God!
5231	My mom's home. Quick!
5232	- Get under my bed. - What?!
5233	Oh, my God!
5234	You only get one shot at losing your virginity.
5235	And even though I just barely had sex, it counts.
5236	What do you mean just barely?
5237	Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he...
5238	splashed around in the shallow end.
5239	Then you didn't lose your virginity to him.
5240	- Just barely doesn't count. - Yes, it does.
5241	- No, it doesn't. - Yes, it does.
5242	No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story.
5243	Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot.
5244	Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?
5245	No. Nobody else tested the water, right?
5246	Scooter?
5247	Who's Scooter?
5248	My high school boyfriend, who I did not have sex with.
5249	I... I can't believe this.
5250	We're Marshall and Lily-- when people see us, they say,
5251	"Oh, look at them, they've only had sex with each other."
5252	No, Marshall, they say, "Oh, look at them,
5253	they've only had sex with each other."
5254	But now that's not true anymore--
5255	now you've had sex with twice as many people as I have.
5256	I knew that you were too good at it.
5257	Know what? I don't want to see the stupid Empire State Building anymore.
5258	- It's not stupid. - I'm going to see Kyle.
5259	Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once.
5260	You should only be having sex with someone who's special.
5261	Oh, please-- you've had sex with, like, a hundred guys.
5262	It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys.
5263	I'm sure you were madly in love with all of them.
5264	I had different levels of feeling for each of the...
5265	very reasonable number of guys.
5266	Really.
5267	Well, do you love Ted?
5268	Do you love Ted ?
5269	I, um...
5270	Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22:
5271	The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations.
5272	- You're off the hook, okay? - Just let me explain.
5273	You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.
5274	Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying...
5275	"hm hm hm" is like... getting into the carpool lane.
5276	And I don't want to take an exit, but...
5277	at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane.
5278	Because what's in the carpool lane?
5279	Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get...
5280	Okay, Robin, Robin, stop.
5281	It's no big deal-- you don't have to say it.
5282	It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.
5283	What, you mean like I did?
5284	No.  I didn't...
5285	Yeah, like you did.
5286	I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird.
5287	- Weird... or courageous? - Pretty sure weird.
5288	I mean, who gives it up on the first date?
5289	Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight.
5290	No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut.
5291	Well, then you're an I-love-you prude.
5292	You know what? I take mine back.
5293	- You... What? - I take my "I love you" back.
5294	- You can't take it back. - Nah. Just did. Got it right here.
5295	But, you know, I'm such a slut, I'm just gonna give it away.
5296	Hey, you, sir. I love you.
5297	Thank you, man.
5298	I was going up there to jump.
5299	Marshall, why is this such a big deal?
5300	Why is this such a big deal?
5301	Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus, guess who actually discovered the New World.
5302	Some dude named Scooter.
5303	Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong, it actually goes like this:
5304	"One small step for man, one giant leap for Scooter."
5305	Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve
5306	- before you did... - Okay, Marshall, I get it.
5307	It's a big deal because it rewrites our history.
5308	No, it doesn't.
5309	Look, have you been to the Empire State Building?
5310	No. You've only been in the lobby.
5311	People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby.
5312	They buy tickets to get to the top.
5313	Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count.
5314	Really.
5315	Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building?
5316	Um, we're in it right now.
5317	Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man.
5318	You're right.
5319	Why would I throw that all away?
5320	I'm having the best day!
5321	Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place
5322	to lecture you on romantic relationships, but...
5323	but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made.
5324	- Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay. - That's not what I meant.
5325	I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up.
5326	Please don't do this.
5327	But, kids, later that night, Katie did it,
5328	and she got pregnant... with quintuplets...
5329	and she lived out her days in a trailer park...
5330	where she died an alcoholic.
5331	So the moral here, kids, don't have sex until you're married.
5332	Maybe even, like, a year or two into marriage.
5333	- Dad! - Come on, what really happened?
5334	All right, here's what really happened.
5335	- Hey. - Hey.
5336	She didn't do it.
5337	Hey, that's great! You got through to her.
5338	No, I didn't. You did.
5339	She told me that you talked to her.
5340	Hey, Katie.
5341	Hey.
5342	Got another Empire State Building fun fact for me?
5343	No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours
5344	it took to build this 102-story testament to human will.
5345	So, you okay?
5346	I don't know what everyone is freaking out about.
5347	Kyle, he's a really nice guy.
5348	He could've cheated on me with my lab partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't.
5349	'Cause he said he knew I'd find out.
5350	That's very gallant.
5351	Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either.
5352	- I was your age my first time. - Oh, really?
5353	Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly.
5354	I love you, Ted.
5355	Oh, I love you, too, Molly.
5356	But I didn't.
5357	That was amazing.
5358	Look, I got to go.
5359	Where are you going?
5360	My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico.
5361	We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome.
5362	Well, will you call me?
5363	Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you.
5364	But I didn't.
5365	Molly?
5366	Yeah?
5367	Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.
5368	But I didn't.
5369	And I never saw her again.
5370	I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have sex.
5371	I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and...
5372	that's exactly what I did.
5373	Look, I'm not telling you what to do.
5374	I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like.
5375	Even the nice ones.
5376	So I told Kyle I wanted to wait... and he dumped me.
5377	Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.
5378	Aw, honey.
5379	I promise everything is gonna be okay.
5380	You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?
5381	Only if you put a buttload of Kahlua in it.
5382	Don't tell Mom.
5383	Thanks for doing that.
5384	You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.
5385	But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you.
5386	Yeah, well...
5387	I love you, Molly.
5388	Oh, I love you, too, Ted.
5389	Wow. That was amazing.
5390	Look, I got to go.
5391	Wh-Where are you going?
5392	Uh, my cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico.
5393	We're going into the woods to light them.
5394	It's gonna be awesome.
5395	Will you call me?
5396	Yeah. I'll totally call you.
5397	- Oh, Ted? - Yeah?
5398	Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.
5399	- But she didn't. - Oh, come here.
5400	I love you.
5401	I said it.
5402	Feels right.
5403	-  I love you. - I'm gay.
5404	I'm kidding.
5405	I love you, too.
5406	Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity.
5407	Yeah.
5408	I guess I was just waiting for the right guy.
5409	Katie ended up having a great first time in New York.
5410	And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building.
5411	I am so glad we're finally doing this.
5412	What are you talking about? We were here yesterday.
5413	Yeah, but that didn't really count.
5414	- Oh, crap. - Exactly!
5415	So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building.
5416	So I lost it to you, Marshall.
5417	And I rode that elevator to the top,
5418	and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness.
5419	And that's our story.
5420	Yeah. Yeah, that's our story.
5421	We've only had sex with each other.
5422	We've only had sex with each other.
5423	They've only had sex with each other.
5424	Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go.
5425	Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 81:
5426	There are 1,860 steps from this... Whoa, whoa! Come on!
5427	So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building.
5428	How have you lived here so long and never been to the top?
5429	Well, we're usually busy... drinking.
5430	Speaking of first times, we never got to hear
5431	- your virginity story. - That's right, I almost forgot.
5432	Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout...
5433	Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
5434	I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl...
5435	Risky Business.
5436	I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer...
5437	That's War Games, and there's not even a sex scene in it.
5438	All right!
5439	I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda.
5440	She called me "Barry" the whole time, and for two weeks,
5441	my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy?
5442	Hey...
5443	Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills.
5444	Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's.
5445	Her dad did not approve of our love.
5446	- Did anyone put Baby in a corner? - Oh, God, no.
5447	What can I say, I...
5448	had... the time of my life.
5449	True story.
5450	Some kids dream of being astronauts.
5451	Some kids dream of playing baseball.
5452	When I was a kid, I had only one dream.
5453	To build a skyscraper.
5454	That's stupid.
5455	There were some obstacles along the way.
5456	But eventually my dream came true.
5457	I became an architect.
5458	Morning, everyone!
5459	So, I had an idea for the atrium.
5460	Ready?
5461	Columns.
5462	That's stupid.
5463	I... I can't believe you knocked over my model.
5464	Well, it's just... it's not exactly new, is it-- columns?
5465	I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea-- ceilings?
5466	Floors?
5467	Windows?
5468	I know what you're thinking: Who's this jerk?
5469	Well, this jerk was Hammond Druthers,
5470	a legend in the architecture community.
5471	Very big in the '80s.
5472	He was also far and away the worst boss I ever had.
5473	Then I designed the Spokane National Bank Building.
5474	And suddenly... I was his boss.
5475	- And he didn't like it. - Stairs?
5476	And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either.
5477	See, before, when I was just another employee,
5478	I was happy, carefree.
5479	The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss.
5480	Did you see what he was wearing today?
5481	It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.
5482	Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers, I get hay fever just looking at it.
5483	But suddenly I was a different guy.
5484	Hey, guys.
5485	What's so funny?
5486	Nothing.
5487	Um... nice shirt.
5488	Thanks.
5489	The hours were insane.
5490	I was always working even when I wasn't at work.
5491	Oh, Robin... I just had a great idea.
5492	Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up.
5493	Before, I used to be this guy.
5494	Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert.
5495	Just say you're sick.
5496	But now...
5497	I was this guy.
5498	Sick, huh?
5499	Unbutton your shirt.
5500	Hmm... "Foo Fighters."
5501	Get back to work.
5502	But still, the worst part was Druthers.
5503	- Well, I was thinking... - Ceilings? Oops.
5504	Said that already. Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas.
5505	I'm kidding, of course.
5506	Another hole in one, boss.
5507	Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking.
5508	Why would you say that?
5509	Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that.
5510	I have found that to be true.
5511	It's a blessing and a curse really.
5512	Ted, you can't let him treat you like that.
5513	Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss?
5514	- Tony. - Angela.   - Mona.
5515	Mona?
5516	Watch it more closely. Rock your world.
5517	So, what are you gonna do?
5518	Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss.
5519	So, I went to talk to the managing partner.
5520	Fire him.
5521	Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project.
5522	Fire him!
5523	He's an arrogant, washed-up, pain in the ass.
5524	In fact, fire everyone on that project.
5525	Druthers, Mosby, the whole lot of them.
5526	Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear Mosby's doing some great work.
5527	Fine, Mosby can stay. But tell him he's on thin ice.
5528	Come here.
5529	I like you, Crosby.
5530	You mind if I charge my phone?
5531	Knock yourself out.
5532	Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing.
5533	Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?
5534	Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this,
5535	but there's been some budget cuts and, um,
5536	we have to let you go.
5537	I mean, after tonight.
5538	I still need my makeup for the broadcast.
5539	So...
5540	Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims.
5541	You know what? I'm gonna do it.
5542	I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow.
5543	- Oh, my God! - What?
5544	- Do you know about this? - No.
5545	What is that?
5546	Only the greatest thing ever.
5547	Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup.
5548	If they were to cure cancer tomorrow,
5549	this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week.
5550	Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall.
5551	Oh, my God.
5552	This  is awesome times awesome.
5553	It's awesome squared.
5554	I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time.
5555	Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it,
5556	he clearly doesn't want us to find it.
5557	Oh, come on, Robin.
5558	No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this.
5559	We are gonna have so much fun.
5560	I know! We're gonna have so much fun!
5561	Oh, sorry I'm late; lunch ran a little long.
5562	You wanted to see me, Mosby?
5563	Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.
5564	Well, excuse me, for spending the last four hours
5565	drawing designs for your building.
5566	This is a cocktail napkin.
5567	Covered in profanity.
5568	Look, Hammond, um,
5569	there's no easy way to say this, so...
5570	why don't we just, um, step into your office.
5571	# Happy birthday to you #
5572	- # Happy birthday to you # - Oh, you had me. You so had me.
5573	# Happy birthday, dear Hammond #
5574	# Happy birthday to you #
5575	So, you didn't fire him?
5576	I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me.
5577	Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised.
5578	Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat.
5579	I know how much you love stools.
5580	Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture.
5581	And, uh... I... got you a rose.
5582	Thank you. That's so sweet.
5583	You guys are being... so sweet.
5584	Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart.
5585	Oh, wow, a new dart.
5586	Hey, that new dart is great.
5587	I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney.
5588	Oh, yes, Robin, I just love new dart.
5589	Nude art.
5590	- Nude art. - Nude art.
5591	Okay, all right, so what, you guys found the painting, huh?
5592	I knew this day would come.
5593	How did you know that?
5594	Because I didn't hide it very well.
5595	So the story on the painting is that, back in college,
5596	Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class.
5597	Marshall wasn't so into the idea.
5598	Well, I just... don't think that some dude
5599	should drop trou just to pose for you.
5600	It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.
5601	The frisbee dude with the soul patch?
5602	He's like the hottest guy in school!
5603	No, he's actually a little husky...
5604	Oh, he's just huggable!
5605	And complicated...
5606	and a little bit of a jerk.
5607	Just enough so you think maybe you can change him.
5608	Okay, just forget it.
5609	Call me old-fashioned,
5610	I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked.
5611	Well, then you'll have to do it.
5612	Are you kidding me? What if somebody sees it?
5613	We're not in high school anymore.
5614	People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting.
5615	We're adults now.
5616	We totally saw your butt.
5617	This painting has caused too much grief already.
5618	I'm destroying it right now.
5619	Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall?
5620	Where is it?
5621	I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three.
5622	You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?
5623	Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles?
5624	Field trip!
5625	Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar.
5626	Classic!
5627	What a memorable prank.
5628	Hey, Marshall. What'll you have?
5629	What'll I have? Um, I don't know, maybe a beer
5630	and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar!
5631	Ooh,  I'm sorry, that painting's property of the bar.
5632	I know that Barney gave you that painting.
5633	I don't know what you're talking about.
5634	Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay you double.
5635	I doubt it.
5636	Whatever he's paying you, I'll give you that plus ten bucks.
5637	I doubt it.
5638	All right, you know what, Carl, you just lost yourself a regular customer.
5639	I doubt it.
5640	This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
5641	Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school?
5642	Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh!
5643	How much do billboards cost?
5644	Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse.
5645	I've got a five-year rollout plan.
5646	I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city.
5647	Then, after New York...
5648	One of my worst fears has come true--
5649	I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked.
5650	Well, I gotta go.
5651	Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office.
5652	Oh, I'll go out with you.
5653	Bye, guys.
5654	You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting.
5655	Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall.
5656	The painting's actually really great.
5657	-  Are you serious? - Yeah.
5658	Well, thank you.
5659	You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes.
5660	What?
5661	Paint me.
5662	What?
5663	Paint  me.
5664	Who's that?
5665	Who's out there?
5666	Hammond, is that you?
5667	Mosby?
5668	Druthers and I were alone in the office.
5669	If I was gonna fire him,
5670	this would be the best chance I'd ever have.
5671	Uh, look, just a second, Ted.
5672	Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you.
5673	Look, there's no easy way to say...
5674	What, what are you doing?
5675	What are you doing?
5676	I'm standing here wearing pants.
5677	Are you sleeping here? What's going on?
5678	Okay, fine, yes.
5679	Not that it's any of your business
5680	but my wife had a little spat a few weeks ago,
5681	and I've been sleeping here until she cools off.
5682	Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business.
5683	Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I...
5684	Who am I kidding?
5685	She's never gonna take me back.
5686	It's okay.
5687	What did you want to say to me?
5688	Happy birthday, buddy.
5689	So, you've been living at the office?
5690	Yes.
5691	I'm an architect without a home.
5692	You see the tragic irony in that?
5693	- Yeah, I do. - 'Cause I design homes.
5694	- I see it. - But I don't have a home.
5695	Not lost on me at all.
5696	But I don't understand-- why don't you just go to a hotel?
5697	You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of...
5698	what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building.
5699	Why would I go to a hotel, when any second,
5700	she's going to call and tell me to come home.
5701	She's a very special lady, Ted.
5702	She's quite... mannish.
5703	She gives me what I need.
5704	Do you understand that?
5705	Uh, no, I don't.
5706	If you were lost in the wilderness,
5707	she can provide for me.
5708	Well, that's the dream.
5709	I'm glad you came here tonight, Ted.
5710	Me too, Hammond.
5711	- Call me Ham. - No, thanks.
5712	- Hammy D? - No, I think just Hammond.
5713	So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him.
5714	I was this close.
5715	Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night
5716	in the grips of a dilemma.
5717	- Oh honey, you're awake? - I'm awake.
5718	- Is everything okay? - Yeah.
5719	I've kind of been wrestling with something.
5720	What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon?
5721	Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for.
5722	We're going to Howe Caverns.
5723	Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?
5724	It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves.
5725	It's an underground adventure.
5726	There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there.
5727	I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark.
5728	Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money
5729	so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns,
5730	but in Scotland?
5731	- Loch Ness? - Yeah.
5732	And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow...
5733	Loch Ness. Nessy.
5734	Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch,
5735	but... we can't afford that.
5736	Maybe we can.
5737	Paint me.
5738	Okay, I don't get this.
5739	You've been making fun of that painting all this time
5740	and now you want me to paint you?
5741	We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame.
5742	I do not.
5743	In my body, where the shame gland should be,
5744	there's a second awesome gland.
5745	True story.
5746	Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting.
5747	Yeah.
5748	A nude Barney is a challenge.
5749	But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this.
5750	Now is the time-- I'm 31.
5751	I'm at the peak of my physical beauty.
5752	If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago.
5753	Long ago.
5754	Forget it.
5755	I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.
5756	I'll give you $5,000.
5757	We're going to Loch Ness!
5758	Yeah!
5759	That cabby would not shut up.
5760	Yeah, we should call him a gabby.
5761	I think it, you say it.
5762	Hey, uh... thanks for putting me up last night, buddy.
5763	Give 'em hell.
5764	Morning, team.
5765	So, I have given it some thought,
5766	and I say we revisit columns.
5767	Oh, God, not this again.
5768	Ted, a man in a toga just arrived and delivered a parchment.
5769	Let me read it:
5770	Oh! It's from ancient Greece.
5771	They want their basic architectural elements back.
5772	- Geez. - What?
5773	You didn't hear me?
5774	Toga, parchment...
5775	Can I see you for one second?
5776	Ooh, I'm in trouble now.
5777	What are you doing?
5778	I thought we were friends.
5779	You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal.
5780	I tossed you more toilet paper.
5781	We are friends.
5782	But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good.
5783	What? I don't believe this!
5784	You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes!
5785	And my girlfriend's... sneakers--
5786	man, you have weirdly small feet.
5787	Ted, I hope that you're not going to let our professional woes
5788	interfere with our friendship,
5789	because I really kind of need you right now.
5790	Okay, let's get this over with.
5791	Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in.
5792	This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art.
5793	I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift.
5794	Thank you.
5795	I meant me.
5796	Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence.
5797	Goofy and unburdened, with wit.
5798	But me, I want something more regal.
5799	Something my progeny could look at and say,
5800	"There's stands Barnabus Stinson."
5801	He was wise...
5802	and strong.
5803	I don't think your sword will fit.
5804	I get that a lot.
5805	And so, as Lily began painting,
5806	Marshall thought about the $5,000
5807	and what his fiancée was doing to earn it.
5808	This isn't right.
5809	This isn't right at all.
5810	Finally, he could take it no more.
5811	Hold still.
5812	Hold still.
5813	- Hold still! - Paint faster!
5814	Okay, I guess it's time.
5815	Drop your shorts.
5816	Yeah.
5817	Wait, wait!
5818	That wasn't enough buildup. I need...
5819	In a world without justice, one man--
5820	- Oh, just drop them! - All right.
5821	- No! No, this is not right! - We had a deal!
5822	Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!
5823	- You...! - It's over!
5824	Lily, I can't let you go through with this!
5825	I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand.
5826	It's just not right!
5827	It's beautiful and they say it's haunted.
5828	I can't let the woman I love compromise her values for money!
5829	I totally think we can get some more money out of him.
5830	I'm never letting my fiancée, ever...!
5831	Oh, you're still here?
5832	Before you say anything,
5833	I'll give you an extra five grand.
5834	We accept.
5835	You people are so easy to control.
5836	Dance for me, puppets, dance.
5837	And  that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.
5838	Come on, Ted, listen, why don't we get back
5839	and finish drawing the plans for a building
5840	which, in my opinion, is never going to get built,
5841	so you and I can get out of here and grab a couple of beers.
5842	No.
5843	Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but...
5844	Looking for Hammond Druthers.
5845	Oh, that's me. I'm Hammond Druthers.
5846	These are divorce papers.
5847	You've been served.
5848	Oh, God.
5849	She's really going through with this.
5850	So that's it. It's over.
5851	There is no easy way to say this, but...
5852	She's giving me the remains of Wolfie?
5853	My dog is dead?
5854	Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
5855	She always played too rough with him.
5856	Believe me, there is no easy way to say this--
5857	- # Happy birthday to you... # - You've got to be kidding me!
5858	Guys, you have no idea how much this means to me right now.
5859	Wait, his birthday was yesterday!
5860	Yeah, but a bunch of us were up at the conference in Montreal,
5861	- so we thought... - No! No birthday! No!
5862	I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out.
5863	Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died,
5864	and that your wife is divorcing you and that...
5865	your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday.
5866	And there is no easy way to say...
5867	What are you doing? What's going on?
5868	Oh, God...
5869	Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you?
5870	Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground.
5871	Well, nice try, but guess what?
5872	You're fired!
5873	You're fired-- you get it? You hear me?
5874	You're gone! You're fired!
5875	In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond
5876	might have been faking.
5877	On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine
5878	and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack,
5879	even if they said it a bit begrudgingly.
5880	And there it was, rock bottom:
5881	They all hated me.
5882	But just when all seemed lost,
5883	I had the greatest idea of my entire career.
5884	Margarita Fridays-- great idea, boss.
5885	Okay, it's done.
5886	I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it.
5887	Thank you very much, Lily.
5888	Marshall, do you have the money?
5889	- Yeah. - Let's get out of here!
5890	A smooth area?! You gave me the Ken doll?!
5891	She left out Little Barney.
5892	Barnacle Junior.
5893	My Barnana is...
5894	Barnito Supreme.
5895	Kids, I told you stories about all the big holidays--
5896	Christmas...
5897	Halloween...
5898	Thanksgiving...
5899	but one holiday was always my favorite--
5900	Super Bowl Sunday.
5901	And there was one Super Bowl back in 2007
5902	that I will never forget.
5903	Marshall, you're on beer detail.
5904	Lily, you're making the bean dip.
5905	Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels,
5906	and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do
5907	so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem.
5908	"Problem."
5909	Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something
5910	about his flying problem.
5911	It's not a problem if you're awesome at it.
5912	And I will be going to Quinn's to pick up the world's greatest food,
5913	the Super Bowl Hot Wings Platter.
5914	If I were a chicken, I'd go cannibal for those bad boys.
5915	Just eat my own damn wing off. I don't care.
5916	I'm crazy like that.
5917	Here's the info for tomorrow night.
5918	What's tomorrow night?
5919	Oh, God, you didn't hear?
5920	Mark died.
5921	- Oh, my God. - Oh, my gosh.
5922	The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00, and I know
5923	it would have meant a lot to Mark if you came.
5924	You guys were his favorite customers.
5925	- Stay strong. - We're so sorry.
5926	Who was Mark?
5927	- No idea. - Not a clue.
5928	Well, I guess we should go, right?
5929	Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00, that's the Super Bowl.
5930	Okay, I feel terrible, but the truth is we didn't know Mike.
5931	- Mark. - Mark,
5932	and as long as we send flowers,
5933	I can't think of any reason we'd have to go.
5934	Get out of here!
5935	I never want to see your face in this bar again!
5936	This soulless bastard just told me he can't come to Mark's funeral
5937	because he wants to watch the Super Bowl.
5938	Could you believe that?
5939	You guys are coming, right?
5940	Yes... Wouldn't miss for the world.
5941	Okay, here's the plan :
5942	record the game, go to the funeral,
5943	- pay our respects to Matt... - Mark.
5944	Mark, and start watching only an hour late.
5945	Okay, that's great, but just to make sure it records,
5946	maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer
5947	to the TiVo gods.
5948	Almighty TiVo,
5949	we thank you for all the gifts you have given us:
5950	the power to freeze live TV to go take a leak
5951	is nothing short of Godlike.
5952	Let's not forget fast-forwarding through commercials.
5953	It seems greedy to ask anything more from you,
5954	O magic box,
5955	but if you malfunction and miss the Super Bowl,
5956	we will destroy you in the alley with baseball bats.
5957	- Amen. - Amen.
5958	We are not fast-forwarding through the commercials.
5959	Yeah, they're the best part.
5960	Oh, come on. Remember last year?
5961	Who wants to watch a monkey in a coconut bra order a pizza?
5962	Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute.
5963	Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today.
5964	Okay.
5965	Good-bye.
5966	You  didn't hang up either!
5967	I know! You hang up!
5968	You hang up!
5969	My bookie. Great guy.
5970	So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up?
5971	Have I taught you nothing, Ted?
5972	Virtually.
5973	Suits are full of joy.
5974	They're the sartorial equivalent of a baby's smile.
5975	"Sartorial"?
5976	"Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade."
5977	Suits are for the living.
5978	That's why when it's my time to R.I.P.
5979	I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it--
5980	buck naked. Yeah.
5981	It's gonna be awesome.
5982	Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies.
5983	What up?!
5984	- Such a waste. - I know.
5985	He was so young.
5986	A hand-stitched, cashmere, double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana.
5987	It must be so frightened.
5988	This is going faster than I thought.
5989	We'll make an appearance at the bar for the wake,
5990	we'll be watching the game by 8:00.
5991	And even though we didn't see any whales,
5992	Mark and I both said it was the best day of our lives.
5993	Okay, I'm getting us another round.
5994	And when I come back,
5995	everyone else is telling their favorite Mark story.
5996	Dibs on the one Carl just told.
5997	Okay, I have to be at work exactly one Super Bowl from now.
5998	Oh, let's face it, we're not going to get to watch it.
5999	We should just find out the score.
6000	Oh, thank God! I'll find out.
6001	No, no, no, we can't! We have to watch the game together.
6002	It's tradition.
6003	Think of all the great times we've had watching this game.
6004	Second down, everyone drink.
6005	Ted, it's not a drinking game
6006	if you drink anytime anything happens.
6007	Are these chicken wings or angel wings?
6008	God, I love these things.
6009	I love you guys.
6010	This is so great, all of us watching the Super Bowl together.
6011	This is special.
6012	We need to do this every year-- promise me!
6013	Calm down, buddy.
6014	Oh, commercials!
6015	Everyone drink!
6016	God, this is such a great tradition, all of us watching the game together.
6017	How did this start?
6018	Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal.
6019	I don't bet. Betting's for suckers.
6020	Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal.
6021	Fine.
6022	See, there you go, he made it. You win.
6023	Wait. This is mine, just like that?
6024	God, that feels good.
6025	No, that feels really... good.
6026	What else can we bet on?
6027	Nothing, it's the halftime show.
6028	Oh, so lame.
6029	Nobody even pays attention.
6030	I mean, Janet Jackson, who cares?
6031	God, how cool is Robin?
6032	I  can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months
6033	to our sacred day.
6034	Now she's gonna be in all the pictures.
6035	Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks
6036	plus six points for 500 bucks.
6037	Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.
6038	$50?! What fun is $50?!
6039	Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall!
6040	Okay, $50.
6041	Hey, I'll take that action.
6042	Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand.
6043	Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings?
6044	Oh, commercials!
6045	Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious.
6046	Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together.
6047	So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6:00
6048	and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won.
6049	That's impossible.
6050	I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy.
6051	That means no TV, no Internet,
6052	no newspapers, nothing.
6053	Media blackout.
6054	But our tradition lives on.
6055	Who's in?
6056	- I'm in. - I'm in.
6057	- I'm in. - What the hell, I'm in.
6058	- High five! - Dude, we're at a wake.
6059	Sorry. Solemn low five.
6060	As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be
6061	to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl.
6062	I decided to work from home to avoid contamination
6063	by the outside world.
6064	Hey, take this key and swallow it.
6065	What? No.
6066	Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time.
6067	Lots more, no.
6068	I'm not messing around, Theodore.
6069	I've got a lot of money riding on this game.
6070	If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator,
6071	I'll check the score. Please take the key.
6072	Fine.
6073	But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan
6074	and I think that's funny.
6075	The media blackout was particularly hard on Robin
6076	because, well, she was the media.
6077	But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing
6078	the unusually large pothole any time soon,
6079	so buckle up if you're on the BQE.
6080	It's gonna be a bumpy one.
6081	Like  morning commutes needed to get any harder.
6082	You're right, Kevin.
6083	Well, Robin, what do you say? I think it's time to check in with Sid
6084	- for a sports update. - No!
6085	- What? - No.
6086	But it's, uh, time for Sports.
6087	No, it's not. It's time for Weather.
6088	We, we just did Weather.
6089	Well, weather's pretty fickle,
6090	it may have changed.
6091	What's it doing out there, Lou?
6092	Pretty much the same thing it was two minutes ago.
6093	Back to you, Robin.
6094	Okay, now it's time for Sports.
6095	No! Let's go to Traffic Todd
6096	in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper.
6097	Robin, it's time for Sports!
6098	Over to you, Sid.
6099	Thank you, Kevin and Robin.
6100	Let's talk about the Super Bowl.
6101	Weeks earlier, Marshall had promised Lily
6102	he'd come into her kindergarten class for show-and-tell day.
6103	And he's a little bit double-jointed...
6104	And his favorite animal is the Loch Ness monster.
6105	Lily, how many times...?
6106	Nessie is a gentle creature.
6107	We're  trying to stay away from terms like "Monster."
6108	Well, I think we can all agree, he is much more interesting
6109	than Sally's one-eyed goldfish.
6110	Three weeks in a row? Come on, Sally.
6111	Okay, well, that's all the time we have.
6112	Arts and crafts, everybody.
6113	Hey. I'm Doug.
6114	Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.
6115	Are you going to be staying here for the rest of day?
6116	Yeah, I'm actually trying to hide out
6117	'cause I don't want to know who won the Super Bowl.
6118	I know who won.
6119	Oh, um, that's great, but I really don't want to know,
6120	so  if you could just keep that to yourself.
6121	How badly do you not want to know?
6122	Excuse me?
6123	Ten bucks.
6124	Are you serious?
6125	Just went up to eight.
6126	Unlock me, Ted.
6127	I've never gone this long without calling my bookie.
6128	He worries.
6129	Not until game time.
6130	Where are you going?
6131	Pick up the hot wings.
6132	What? How the hell are you planning on getting
6133	in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score?
6134	There's TVs everywhere.
6135	Ah, don't worry.
6136	I got it all planned out.
6137	First of all:
6138	I placed duct tape on a pair of sunglasses
6139	so I can only see out of two tiny holes.
6140	Next, I constructed blinders out of an old cereal box.
6141	Top it all off: high-tech noise-reducing headphones
6142	I bought when Marshall and Lily first got back together
6143	and were doing it a lot.
6144	I call it the Sensory Deprivator 5000.
6145	Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby.
6146	I'm here to pick up my hot wings.
6147	In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings
6148	plus a generous tip.
6149	Please take the cash.
6150	Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way.
6151	Thank you!
6152	And that closes the book on one heck of a Super Bowl.
6153	Back to you, Kevin and Robin.
6154	We'll be right back.
6155	And we're clear.
6156	I'm sorry.
6157	Um, Robin, is it just me,
6158	or were you doing something different there?
6159	I haven't watched the game yet.
6160	I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast
6161	there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl.
6162	I mean, change the teleprompter.
6163	No team names, nothing specific.
6164	That is crazy. I can't do that.
6165	My friend Mark passed away this week.
6166	Okay, sweety okay. Okay, I'm so sorry.
6167	Back in five... four...
6168	- three... - It's just so hard.
6169	Ha! Who's the idiot now?!
6170	You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid.
6171	But it totally worked!
6172	I couldn't see or hear anything happening around me.
6173	Right?! Right?!
6174	No...!
6175	And if that weren't bad enough,
6176	I was about to have a horrible realization.
6177	Where's the dipping sauce?
6178	The team that won, want to know what their name rhymes with?
6179	Come on, dude. You promised you'd stop
6180	if I ate all those crayons.
6181	Why are you doing this?
6182	I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.
6183	Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin, she's mine.
6184	Okay, now who did this?
6185	I did.
6186	Does that mean Marshall gets a time-out?
6187	Well, Marshall's a grownup, so...
6188	When one of us breaks something, we get a time-out.
6189	Sorry.
6190	And after the Super Bowl,
6191	the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up,
6192	sending the mayor of the winning team's city
6193	15 pounds of a delicacy his or her city is famous for.
6194	Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer
6195	one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor.
6196	Hey.
6197	- Hey. - I'm not talking to you.
6198	Yes, you are.
6199	You'll do whatever I say.
6200	- Hold your breath. - I'm not holding my breath.
6201	The winning team was the...
6202	Now here's how this is going to work:
6203	you're going to take me to three R-rated movies a week...
6204	And then Uncle Marshall got an idea.
6205	It was not one he was proud of in retrospect,
6206	but desperate times...
6207	Oh, no.
6208	Somebody wet their pants.
6209	- No, I didn't. - Oh, really?
6210	Who's everyone gonna believe?
6211	I'm a grownup third-year law student at Columbia
6212	and you're just a little pants wetter. So now I ask you a question:
6213	You want to be able to quietly sneak off to the restroom and dry off
6214	or am I gonna have something for show and tell today?
6215	- Hey, everyone... - Okay, okay.
6216	You win.
6217	I want my money back.
6218	And your pudding snack pack.
6219	Sir, who won the Super Bowl?
6220	Sorry. I missed the game.
6221	You missed...?! How could he miss...?
6222	Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!
6223	I... don't really follow sports.
6224	Oh, my...!
6225	Emmitt Smith!
6226	Oh, thank God.
6227	Yeah, I get that a lot.
6228	You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?
6229	The game was last night?
6230	You know, once you win two or three of those things,
6231	it's kind of like, eh.
6232	But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday.
6233	What could possibly be more important than football?!
6234	Dance, my friend. Dance.
6235	No...!
6236	Hello! It's me again.
6237	Oh! I didn't recognize you.
6238	Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce!
6239	Ah. Yes.
6240	This is the one.
6241	It was 4:00, and so far, all of us had done the impossible.
6242	But then, almost simultaneously,
6243	things started to go wrong.
6244	And let's end the day on a happy note.
6245	There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo.
6246	Trish Sanchez has the story.
6247	- Hey, buddy. - Hey, dude, look out.
6248	And in honor of yesterday's big win...
6249	- Hey, buddy, look out. - Dude, watch out!
6250	...the zoo decided to name the baby panda
6251	after Super Bowl champions...
6252	No...!
6253	No...!
6254	No...!
6255	Yes...!
6256	Awesome. Just in time for kick-off.
6257	None of you guys found out the score, right?
6258	- Mission accomplished. - Didn't find out.
6259	Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded
6260	through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready.
6261	Barney, I can't even look at you.
6262	I don't want any sign of who won.
6263	Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away.
6264	Feel free to start without me.
6265	Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
6266	So much money! You screwed it up, Barney!
6267	You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
6268	Okay,  let's watch the game.
6269	Barney, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on.
6270	Now you've ruined the game for everyone.
6271	Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.
6272	Way to blow it.
6273	Yeah, I didn't know and now I do know.
6274	There's no point in even watching the game.
6275	Well, at least the commercials aren't ruined.
6276	Wings are still good.
6277	Beer still works.
6278	Ah, what the hell.
6279	Let's watch Barney lose some money.
6280	Hey, so check this out:
6281	I got extorted by a five-year-old today.
6282	I almost got fired today.
6283	I met Emmitt Smith today.
6284	Ooh, you go first.
6285	I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000.
6286	Yeah, go ahead, Barney.
6287	Well, I was frantically running down the street
6288	trying to find out the score to the game...
6289	And here's the funny part,
6290	as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was,
6291	here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won...
6292	Hell, I don't even remember who played.
6293	What I do remember is that we drank beer,
6294	I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet.
6295	Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges,
6296	coin toss...
6297	What are the odds of losing the coin toss?
6298	50-50, give or take.
6299	Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks,
6300	whether or not there'd be a safety, first...
6301	<i>Kids, never underestimate the power of destiny.</i>
6302	<i>Because when you least expect it, the littlest thing</i>
6303	<i>can cause a ripple effect that changes your life.</i>
6304	<i>Take for instance my trip to Chicago.</i>
6305	That security guard was a little bit handsy.
6306	That's funny. She barely touched me.
6307	Uh, Gate 23. Come on.
6308	If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself.
6309	<i>Why was this flight so important?</i>
6310	<i>Let's back up a few months to the fall of 2006.</i>
6311	<i>I had just sold my first building design and become</i>
6312	<i>the youngest project manager in my firm's history.</i>
6313	<i>Suddenly I was being headhunted.</i>
6314	<i>One firm was even considering me to run their entire New York office.</i>
6315	<i>They were flying me in for a final interview at their corporate headquarters in Chicago.</i>
6316	<i>It was the opportunity of a lifetime.</i>
6317	<i>It was my destiny. There was just one problem.</i>
6318	Hi, wait, two more.
6319	Sorry, you're too late, I already shut the doors.
6320	Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them.
6321	Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but see, once  I close those doors, that's it.
6322	Nobody else is allowed down that jet-way.
6323	Except for that guy.
6324	Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job.
6325	I'm sorry, sir.
6326	His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job?
6327	Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do?
6328	I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to  bed at night dreaming about being a...
6329	I mean, uh...
6330	This is a cool job.
6331	Please, I have to be on this flight.
6332	I'll see what I can do. But it doesn't look good.
6333	Thanks.
6334	Your uniforms are pretty.
6335	Okay.
6336	They haven't armed the doors yet, so you still have a chance.
6337	It's up to the captain now and they're calling us back.
6338	Great, please let us know soon as you hear anything.
6339	Sure, and for the future, we recommend you arrive
6340	at the airport an hour and a half before your flight,
6341	not, you know, one minute after.
6342	Normally, I'm incredibly responsible.
6343	I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced.
6344	Not that I'm a criminal or anything.
6345	Yeah, he just jumped a subway turnstile.
6346	You seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel.
6347	Hello?
6348	Oh, that is great news.
6349	It's my mom-- she found her missing earring.
6350	Have a seat. I'll call you when I hear something.
6351	Where was it?
6352	That thing better have call waiting.
6353	Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?
6354	It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today.
6355	I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage.
6356	I'm so stupid.
6357	Why did I have to jump that turnstile?
6358	Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.
6359	And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?
6360	<i>She had a point. It was kind of Barney's fault.</i>
6361	<i>Let's back up a few months.</i>
6362	Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?
6363	Oh, man, it kills. You  want some aspirin, baby?
6364	You know I don't believe in pain killers.
6365	Wow, your first broken bone.
6366	Kind of kills your whole "Unbreakable" theory.
6367	Marshall used to think he was indestructible.
6368	Well, it added up. I've never broken anything.
6369	I've never been sick, and when I need to,
6370	I can summon incredible strength.
6371	Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door.
6372	There was a really heavy door. He opened it.
6373	On one pull.
6374	Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow.
6375	Yeah. It sucks,
6376	all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.
6377	Training for a marathon.
6378	What?
6379	You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.
6380	You're kidding, right?
6381	Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.
6382	So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed,
6383	and just run the New York City Marathon? Absolutely.
6384	Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers.
6385	Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here.
6386	Barney, it's like 26 miles.
6387	Here's how you run a marathon.
6388	Step one, you start running.
6389	There is no step two.
6390	Okay, you know what? Prove it.
6391	Take my number and run in my place.
6392	I will bet you 50 bucks you don't even finish the race.
6393	50 bucks?
6394	Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone.
6395	Make it $10,000.
6396	You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.
6397	Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50.
6398	<i>The next morning, as the marathon began,</i>
6399	<i>we were focused on Marshall's computer.</i>
6400	Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online,
6401	see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe.
6402	Ooh, he's starting! This ought to be good.
6403	He's already passing the second checkpoint.
6404	This tracking thing is amazing.
6405	When we get married, you're getting one of these.
6406	Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive.
6407	He's gotta be cheating, okay. He knew we'd check.
6408	Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet.
6409	Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang "Hungry Like the Wolf,"
6410	and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to?
6411	Well, it looks like, "Barney" should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge
6412	and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But...
6413	there is no way that that's really him.
6414	It's really him.
6415	Hey! That's mine.
6416	Yeah, you'd better run!
6417	- What up, non-finishers? - Wow.
6418	- Very impressive, Barney. - Right?
6419	Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better,
6420	but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour
6421	and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's.
6422	I  won.
6423	I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.
6424	So where's my 50 bucks?
6425	All right.
6426	I got to admit, you earned this.
6427	Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet.
6428	Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym.
6429	Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners  get to use the subway for free today.
6430	Wow. You know I really should check out this "subway."
6431	Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it.
6432	Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it
6433	and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.
6434	You're dating a girl from New Jersey?
6435	No.
6436	<i>So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon.</i>
6437	<i>But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.</i>
6438	- Hello? - Ted, it's Barney.
6439	Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.
6440	What, what are you talking about?
6441	I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.
6442	Finisher.
6443	Yeah, you know what I mean.
6444	86th street.
6445	My legs don't work.
6446	I've already ridden the subway twice end to end.
6447	I've seen where it turns around.
6448	Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.
6449	Barney's legs won't work.
6450	He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.
6451	Best 50 bucks I ever spent.
6452	Listen to me, Ted.
6453	I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train
6454	heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx.
6455	Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?
6456	All right. I'll be right there.
6457	Stay where you are.
6458	Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?
6459	I'm sorry. I can't.
6460	Douche.
6461	- Barney?! - Ted!
6462	No...!
6463	See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon,
6464	you  never would have jumped that turnstile,
6465	you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight.
6466	You're right. Everything can be traced back to him.
6467	Like that rash we all got at Christmas.
6468	All right, I have to see what's going on.
6469	- So I was able to get you two seats. - Really? That's great!
6470	No, no, not you. I'm talking to my mom about Blue Man Group.
6471	Ma, can I call you back?
6472	Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on?
6473	I'm still waiting for... Huh.
6474	Looks like your flight left already.
6475	What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today.
6476	Well, he never even called you back?
6477	Well, it's typical pilot. They don't call you back at work
6478	and they don't call you back after you spend two nights with them
6479	at a Radisson in Orlando.
6480	<i>It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me</i>
6481	<i>to Chicago on time for my job interview,</i>
6482	<i>but it was all the way on the other side of the airport.</i>
6483	What was the name of the airline again?
6484	I think it was something like Flights R' Us.
6485	Was the "R" backwards? God, I hope not.
6486	- Geez. - Stupid smart carts.
6487	More  like dumb carts.
6488	If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault.
6489	You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place
6490	- if Marshall hadn't broken his toe. - Yeah, so?
6491	What, you think this is my fault?
6492	<i>For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April.</i>
6493	My pants are starting to feel a little tight.
6494	Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly.
6495	I cannot allow this.
6496	What?
6497	I am going to run the New York City Marathon.
6498	"It is important to load up on carbohydrates
6499	two to four hours before a big run.
6500	Try  a breakfast of a bagel, a banana,
6501	oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice."
6502	Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said.
6503	Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style.
6504	Liquids are digested faster.
6505	That way, no energy is wasted,
6506	and it's all about the run.
6507	"Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement."
6508	This is gonna be your best run yet.
6509	You're going to accomplish all of your goals.
6510	You are a robot sent from the future
6511	to win the marathon!
6512	You are... Marshall.
6513	You are... Marshall.
6514	You are Marshall! Yeah!
6515	"Chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas,
6516	including the feet, armpits, or even the nipples.
6517	Try using some petroleum jelly on the affected areas."
6518	Oh, gosh!
6519	Dude, you are a terrific runner.
6520	Tomorrow you're gonna run and finish the New York City Marathon!
6521	You're the best.
6522	You look good.
6523	Nobody does it better than you.
6524	Marshall? Oh, my God!
6525	So, yes, it was your fault.
6526	I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day,
6527	Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place,
6528	I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date,
6529	and we make our flight in plenty of time!
6530	And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.
6531	That really wasn't my fault.
6532	I wouldn't have walked in on Marshall if it weren't for Lily.
6533	Hey, think about it.
6534	Hey, what's going on here? Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.
6535	Yeah, but for what?
6536	I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line
6537	"Annual wedding dress blowout.
6538	Designer sample dresses up to 90% off.
6539	Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m."
6540	Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?
6541	We have to camp out.
6542	- Are you serious? - You don't understand.
6543	This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before,
6544	but I never knew where it was.
6545	We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.
6546	I can't go. I've got this thing.
6547	- What thing? - A penis.
6548	- This is the place. - Oh, wow.
6549	Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet!
6550	Vera Wang!
6551	Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here?
6552	You said wang.
6553	Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998.
6554	Only fewer mullets.
6555	You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York.
6556	Ooh, this is comfy.
6557	We might actually be able to sleep.
6558	That's kind of annoying.
6559	Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute.
6560	I don't think I can take this.
6561	Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again,
6562	but then it does.
6563	Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on?
6564	It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why...
6565	Why don't we make a game out of it, okay?
6566	Why don't we sing along?
6567	If we get through this,
6568	I swear I'm gonna live my life differently.
6569	I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time.
6570	Morning, ladies.
6571	- It's him. It's the car guy! - Get out of here!
6572	<i>The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn,</i>
6573	<i>so while I was at work,</i>
6574	<i>she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours,</i>
6575	<i>and that's when...</i>
6576	Nobody does it better than you.
6577	Marshall?! Oh, my God!
6578	So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store,
6579	we would have made the first flight.
6580	Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it.
6581	Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight.
6582	Oh, my God!
6583	You're that reporter from Metro News 1.
6584	Yes, yes, I am.
6585	I can't believe you recognized me.
6586	- You did that story on the giant pizzas? - Would you check to see
6587	- if you have any more seats? - One moment, sir.
6588	Were those pizzas real? Come on, were they?
6589	- Robin... - One second, Ted.
6590	Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that.
6591	The truth is, the pizzas were real.
6592	- Calzones. Trick photography. - I knew it!
6593	God, it is so nice to meet a fan!
6594	And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us
6595	two seats on that next flight.
6596	Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing  up their final seat count.
6597	Let me see what I can find out.
6598	Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny?
6599	I think it might hurt.
6600	This is such a nightmare.
6601	Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out
6602	for a wedding dress?
6603	No. Wait. It goes back further.
6604	Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side?
6605	1939?!
6606	This penny's from 1939!
6607	A 67-year-old penny.
6608	Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II?
6609	Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting.
6610	Look, I know a little something about coins,
6611	and this baby is worth something to a collector.
6612	- No, it's not. - Yes, it is!
6613	You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy.
6614	<i>And that's exactly what I did.</i>
6615	You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty.
6616	Hey, that's 150 times its original value.
6617	Actually, the meal was only $1.49.
6618	1984.
6619	Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again.
6620	How dare you.
6621	Hey, what's going on?
6622	I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.
6623	Yeah, but for what?
6624	It was me.
6625	I started this.
6626	If I hadn't picked up that penny,
6627	we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.
6628	And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store,
6629	Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there,
6630	and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day.
6631	Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe.
6632	Barney wouldn't have run the marathon.
6633	I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile,
6634	gotten arrested, had that court date...
6635	And we would have made our flight.
6636	I don't think we can go back any further than that
6637	unless you know who dropped the penny.
6638	I wish I did.
6639	Though that person's already been punished enough,
6640	losing a sweet penny like that.
6641	Oh,  please tell me you have some good news.
6642	Uh, I'm afraid not.
6643	There are no extra seats on the plane. I'm sorry.
6644	All, right, well, thanks for trying.
6645	I can't believe this. That's it, it's over.
6646	Ted, come on.
6647	Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today.
6648	Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule.
6649	<i>But that's not what happened. They didn't reschedule.</i>
6650	<i>They hired someone else.</i>
6651	<i>And as it turned out, three months later,</i>
6652	<i>that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago.</i>
6653	Kids, funny thing about destiny--
6654	I thought I was destined to get that job.
6655	But I was wrong.
6656	My destiny was to stay in New York.
6657	Because if I hadn't,
6658	I never would have met your mother.
6659	Kids, the key to a good relationship is communication.
6660	- You need to talk. - How about Mimi's?
6661	Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's.
6662	Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go.
6663	Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's.
6664	You love that place-- remember what a great time we had
6665	the last time we were there?
6666	- We did? - Yeah, yeah.
6667	We had that crazy waiter who kept going, "You two should get married!
6668	You two should get married!"
6669	It's also important to know when to stop talking.
6670	Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining.
6671	It was so romantic?
6672	How can you not remember this?
6673	Because it wasn't me.
6674	Oh, right!
6675	It was...
6676	my sister.
6677	You see, by the time you've hit your late 20s,
6678	you've dated a few people,
6679	but when you're in a relationship, it's common courtesy to pretend
6680	that you haven't.
6681	Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on.
6682	Remember when we went to see it?
6683	We sat in the back row.
6684	I've never seen Van Helsing.
6685	That's right. I saw it with my sister.
6686	My boss just got back from Maui.
6687	He said it was really romantic.
6688	Oh, it's so romantic.
6689	When were you in Maui?
6690	- I... went... with my sister. - With my sister.
6691	Why do you always say that?
6692	Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people.
6693	It's silly to try to act like we didn't.
6694	You're right.
6695	We should just be honest.
6696	Totally.
6697	See that girl over there?
6698	Three years ago, I totally made out with her.
6699	I don't want to hear that.
6700	- What? You said... - God, that is so insensitive.
6701	- Remember honesty...? - You're a jerk!
6702	Well, you're...
6703	confusing.
6704	Okay, so you have to have sex with one.
6705	Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human,
6706	or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human.
6707	Go!
6708	I don't know. Is she fat?
6709	Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat.
6710	Hot off the presses!
6711	I-I don't take flyers.
6712	You took one two seconds before you walked in here.
6713	That's different. It was for a strip club.
6714	Two bucks off wings.
6715	How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?
6716	Fine. It's a flyer from my play.
6717	Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college
6718	and I'm not trying to sleep with you.
6719	- So anyway, this mermaid... - Hey, Lily's friend asked her
6720	to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good.
6721	Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this.
6722	Asking someone to come see your play
6723	is like asking someone for a ride to the airport
6724	or to crash on your couch or to help you move.
6725	Call a cab, book a room,
6726	hire some movers and repeat after me:
6727	Friends  don't let friends come see their crappy play.
6728	Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish.
6729	Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.
6730	Yes, you should break up.
6731	So, earlier tonight...
6732	Mm, we should get down to the bar.
6733	I know we should,
6734	but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt.
6735	Oh, God, why is this part of the story?
6736	We're getting to it.
6737	Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here?
6738	Yeah, there's some in the bathroom.
6739	Got to moisturize!
6740	Got to keep that pretty face moist.
6741	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!
6742	- What's wrong with her? - She hates that word.
6743	- What word, "moist"? - No! Seriously, stop!
6744	So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist...
6745	face lotion...
6746	Wow, this is great stuff.
6747	Now I know the secret to your great complexion.
6748	What are you talking about? It's yours.
6749	No, it's not.
6750	Oh, well... then I guess it's Lily's.
6751	No, it's not.
6752	Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?
6753	Um, my sister's.
6754	So, in other words, some girl you went out with.
6755	Um... I love you.
6756	Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?
6757	It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck.
6758	I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face.
6759	Thank you, Marshall.
6760	Thank you so much.
6761	Why is that still in your apartment?
6762	I don't know. I just never threw it out.
6763	Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?
6764	Yeah. I'm madly in love with her,
6765	and the only way I can deal with it
6766	is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion.
6767	Not three dollars! Try 14.
6768	Why is this such a big deal?
6769	Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!
6770	Whoa, she wasn't a whore.
6771	Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town.
6772	It sounds like a whore to me.
6773	What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?
6774	Nothing. That's it.
6775	Well, except for the phone booth.
6776	And the lamp by the desk...
6777	and the...
6778	No.
6779	No! No! Oh, Ted!
6780	Ah, the age-old question:
6781	after  you break up with someone, what do you do with the stuff?
6782	Question? Ain't no question, girl.
6783	Obviously, he's got to get rid of it.
6784	Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it.
6785	So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.
6786	Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.
6787	Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.
6788	Nice, right?
6789	I'm gonna have to say no.
6790	I don't want some 16-year-old girl falling in love with you
6791	and then shooting Lily in the face.
6792	Yes!
6793	I vote they can stay.
6794	"Check out the jackass in the parachute pants" is a good icebreaker.
6795	T ed.
6796	Ted? Ted?
6797	Sorry, buddy, it's a "no" for me, too.
6798	Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called.
6799	Even they don't want those pants back.
6800	They were insanely comfortable!
6801	They were like pajamas you could wear outside.
6802	Marshall, it's over.
6803	We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.
6804	All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first.
6805	Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal.
6806	I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano,
6807	I don't think of Jeannie Radford,
6808	I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe.
6809	And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses.
6810	I remember when I was broke, just out of college,
6811	and I really needed a lamp.
6812	And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein.
6813	I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there.
6814	Creamsicle and turkey gravy,
6815	not at the same time.
6816	Well, that's adorable,
6817	but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see.
6818	I'm Ted's college girlfriend. He made me 12 mix tapes.
6819	How many has he made you?
6820	He calls you "sweetie pie"?
6821	He called me "sweetie pie."
6822	I'm stupid, but my rack is bigger than yours.
6823	Really? You can't look at a pillow
6824	without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!
6825	Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross.
6826	- You're creepy and gross. - Your mom's creepy and gross.
6827	Order! Order!
6828	I got to side with Robin.
6829	She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it.
6830	I've got to side with Ted.
6831	Just 'cause you still have something an ex-girlfriend gave you
6832	doesn't mean you're holding onto her.
6833	All right, Barney.
6834	It all comes down to you.
6835	- I side with Robin. - What?
6836	Ted, your place is too cluttered.
6837	It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.
6838	Or a Danby's.
6839	What, they don't have Danby's in the US?
6840	Really?
6841	Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?
6842	Just stop, sweetie.
6843	So I had no choice.
6844	I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends.
6845	It was painful,
6846	but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night.
6847	New York is famous for its theater,
6848	but there's many different levels.
6849	There's Broadway,
6850	off-Broadway,
6851	off-off-Broadway,
6852	homeless people screaming in the park,
6853	and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in.
6854	Eight flights, of stairs.
6855	Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs?
6856	What kind of building is this?
6857	From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.
6858	Where do you guys want to sit?
6859	I know where I don't want to sit.
6860	Guys, four together!
6861	I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.
6862	Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.
6863	No? Okay.
6864	I... am... Rage!
6865	I... am Greed.
6866	I am Rage... Envy!
6867	I am outta here.
6868	No, you're not. You have to stay.
6869	This is the face of Consumerism!
6870	Oh, my God. Ted's part of the play.
6871	Hello, Greed, Rage...
6872	Envy...
6873	and Consumerism.
6874	I... am your father...
6875	America!
6876	Oh, baby, that was wonderful!
6877	Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer.
6878	And when it became a play within a play,
6879	I was, like, "Now we are really cookin'!"
6880	Wow, Lily, that sucked!
6881	Barney!
6882	What? It was terrible.
6883	I mean, come on. You guys agree, right?
6884	Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.
6885	No, friends make each other feel good.
6886	They build each other up and support them.
6887	That's what being a good friend is about.
6888	Yeah, if you're a Smurf.
6889	You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing
6890	and I would compliment you on it afterwards.
6891	Oh, really? You would?
6892	Yes.
6893	Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.
6894	We'll be starting our Q&A with the director--
6895	yours truly--
6896	in five minutes right here.
6897	Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play?
6898	I know. He can be really insensitive.
6899	It was pretty bad, though.
6900	Oh, my God, it was so bad.
6901	Oh, my God, you've been robbed!
6902	Nope.
6903	All that stuff was from old girlfriends?
6904	Don't you buy anything for yourself?
6905	What can I say?
6906	Papa gets swag.
6907	And that should've been the end of it. But the next day...
6908	You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff.
6909	But seeing how happy it makes you-- totally worth it.
6910	Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have sex with you
6911	when I'm really tired.
6912	Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team.
6913	Well, sit. Sit, yeah.
6914	So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?
6915	Nope.
6916	Well, except for my dogs.
6917	So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships
6918	because you don't keep things from your past relationships
6919	except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right:
6920	your past relationships.
6921	What's your point, Ted?
6922	Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment,
6923	and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?
6924	What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends?
6925	I do now.
6926	That's ridiculous.
6927	I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you.
6928	Well, yeah, but not my dogs.
6929	You said everything.
6930	But not living things.
6931	Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away.
6932	Things with a heartbeat can stay.
6933	Enjoying this?
6934	Pickles, go get your ball.
6935	Go get your ball.
6936	Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you
6937	to make me get rid of all my stuff.
6938	Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?
6939	Guess what position we did it in.
6940	Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs.
6941	Um, no.
6942	Really? Well, I say we take it to the group,
6943	but I don't like your chances.
6944	She's not getting rid of the dogs.
6945	What's the matter with you?
6946	- Even I wouldn't do that. - Yes!
6947	You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair,
6948	but not their dog.
6949	I miss Jebediah.
6950	Oh, I almost forgot.
6951	Flyers for my new play.
6952	Very funny.
6953	Oh, it's not a joke.
6954	It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night.
6955	And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long,
6956	I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends.
6957	Oh, we'll be there.
6958	Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong...
6959	- Never. - Good.
6960	Okay, I gotta go rehearse.
6961	Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho;
6962	the first three rows get wet.
6963	I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from.
6964	I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them.
6965	That was ridiculous.
6966	So we're-we're okay?
6967	Yeah, we're great.
6968	And I thought we were,
6969	but just as it did in the seventh act of Aunt Lily's play,
6970	Jealousy reared its ugly head.
6971	Oh, yeah, that's the spot.
6972	Dude, I gotta pee.
6973	I gotta go.
6974	Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh?
6975	Yeah, he really is.
6976	It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs.
6977	Might be time to send them to the farm.
6978	- You're gonna kill your dogs?! - No! No, no, no,
6979	there really is a farm.
6980	My aunt has a farm upstate.
6981	Oh, thank God.
6982	Aw, you know, if I were five dogs,
6983	I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn.
6984	Yeah. I could visit them on weekends.
6985	My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty.
6986	Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs.
6987	"They"? What do you mean by "they"?
6988	Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate.
6989	Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!
6990	Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
6991	I mean, you know that this is gonna be...
6992	I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing,
6993	and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards.
6994	You know why?
6995	Because that's what friends do.
6996	Moist.
6997	Moist.
6998	Moist.
6999	Moist.
7000	That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.
7001	Moist.
7002	And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.
7003	I have to go refill.
7004	I'll be back in a moment.
7005	Play's not over.
7006	I never get picked for audience participation.
7007	And then it just got weird.
7008	Feelings.
7009	Inside.
7010	Oh, no!
7011	And when that didn't work...
7012	Okay! Stop!
7013	You win. Fine.
7014	Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.
7015	Thank you, Lily.
7016	Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?
7017	No.
7018	No, I have nothing nice to say about your show.
7019	You were right, Barney.
7020	Let's go to the bar.
7021	Yes! I win!
7022	I love winning!
7023	Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily.
7024	I was just getting warmed up, man!
7025	If you had any idea what was coming up in act two... oh!
7026	Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.
7027	Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful.
7028	It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.
7029	Yeah, well, anyway.
7030	Act two is where I really hit my stride.
7031	Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love.
7032	How about this, Barney? How about we stay
7033	and-and watch the rest of your show?
7034	It's your funeral.
7035	Five, six, one, two.
7036	So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half,
7037	'cause that's what friends do, apparently.
7038	Hey.
7039	Where've you been? I called you earlier.
7040	I gave my dogs away to my aunt.
7041	You what?
7042	Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but...
7043	I think it's for the best.
7044	Wow.
7045	Oh, man.
7046	Can we go inside?
7047	Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar.
7048	Why? What's going on inside?
7049	- Um, the floors are gone. - What?
7050	Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed.
7051	This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail.
7052	I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!
7053	You said you threw all that stuff away!
7054	Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had.
7055	It was one of those fights that last for hours
7056	and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about.
7057	We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window.
7058	Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy.
7059	But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me,
7060	but somehow we got to here.
7061	We're really doing this?
7062	Yeah.
7063	- We're moving in together! - We're moving in together!
7064	The robot found love
7065	Confusing my circuitry
7066	My software's been hacked
7067	Toaster oven
7068	You're the one for me
7069	Two, three, four.
7070	That's two.
7071	This is awesome.
7072	I can't believe this moment's finally here.
7073	One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000.
7074	Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero.
7075	And just like an old man,
7076	he leaks fluid, smells stale,
7077	makes weird noises out the back.
7078	Yeah, he does.
7079	Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment.
7080	They're real Cubans. I got 'em in Chinatown last year
7081	just for this moment.
7082	Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off,
7083	but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins.
7084	- What are you talking about? - Whoa, pothole.
7085	What? No. Oh. No.
7086	No, no, no.
7087	No, there's only .8 miles to go. Come on, buddy.
7088	Buddy!
7089	Is it cool if I still light these?
7090	Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be.
7091	When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were.
7092	Maybe a tattoo.
7093	Or a piece of jewelry.
7094	A tiny souvenir that reminds us, "This is who I really am."
7095	Marshall's souvenir was not so tiny,
7096	but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world
7097	and away from his dream of saving the environment,
7098	the tighter he held on to that Fiero.
7099	Hey.
7100	One good thing: we're off the hook for the folding party today.
7101	Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me
7102	that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's...
7103	I couldn't even get through it. Thank God.
7104	Hey, your car's going to be fine.
7105	This is the best auto shop around.
7106	Look at this certificate.
7107	One of the mechanics here
7108	finished a 64-ounce steak.
7109	Surprise.
7110	We felt bad that you guys were missing
7111	the super-fun origami folding party, so...
7112	we suggested moving it here.
7113	We insisted.
7114	Terrific.
7115	How's the Fiero?
7116	She's still in triage.
7117	She? I thought it was your little boy.
7118	Oh, it goes back and forth. It's sort of a tranny car.
7119	How long have you had her... slash him?
7120	My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16.
7121	Oh, how nice of them.
7122	Not really.
7123	Congratulations.
7124	The Fiero is yours.
7125	If you pass the final test.
7126	Come on!
7127	I already shaved my legs and swallowed five dollars in quarters.
7128	Only $4.50 has come out.
7129	Just go to the Weinerburger drive-thru
7130	and get us 12 cups of coffee.
7131	- That's it? - Oh, yeah.
7132	But we get to decide what you wear.
7133	Agreed. Totally agreed.
7134	You're naked.
7135	I'm aware of that.
7136	You have 50 cents?
7137	No...
7138	Look,  can I just have my coffee, please?
7139	Sorry, we're all out of trays and lids.
7140	Two tall guys just came through here a few minutes ago and bought 'em all.
7141	And that is the origin of Marshall's insane
7142	"no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries" rule.
7143	It is not insane.
7144	Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.
7145	Well, I'm trying, but it's...
7146	Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out,
7147	flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half,
7148	fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out.
7149	Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?
7150	Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it.
7151	No.
7152	Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.
7153	Aw, nerts.
7154	The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it.
7155	- Remember the 100K fiasco? - Ah, the Fiero-asco.
7156	Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco.
7157	- What's the 100K fiasco? - The Fiero-asco?
7158	It was just before winter break our freshman year of college.
7159	Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet.
7160	I thought Ted was a little bit pretentious.
7161	And Marshall was a total slob.
7162	Hey.
7163	I'm driving my Fiero back over break.
7164	I know we see enough of each other as it is,
7165	but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money.
7166	You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up.
7167	All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio.
7168	I live in the moment.
7169	Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving.
7170	We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so...
7171	All right, well, call me if you change your mind.
7172	My odometer's going to hit 100K.
7173	She'd be so bummed if I left early.
7174	It was totally mutual.
7175	I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I...
7176	it was... it was totally mutual.
7177	I hear you.
7178	So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious?
7179	Yeah.
7180	Dude, we're college freshmen.
7181	I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with.
7182	Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know?
7183	The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip.
7184	So... this song.
7185	Oh, it's the best song in the world.
7186	It's the only song I like.
7187	Just kidding.
7188	Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years.
7189	Better than nothing, though.
7190	Maybe.
7191	I am so... sick... of this song.
7192	Don't worry. It comes around again.
7193	What do you mean?
7194	# Just to be the man who walks 1,000 miles #
7195	# And falls down at your door... #
7196	Yeah, we totally nailed the ending.
7197	That was probably our best one.
7198	Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog?
7199	- What? - Uh, it's a car game.
7200	Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, "Zitch dog."
7201	- I'm pretty good, so... - Zitch dog.
7202	Well, no, I didn't know we had... we'd started, but...
7203	Okay, that's cool. You got the first point.
7204	- Zitch dog. - Zitch dog. Damn it!
7205	Are we still playing? 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...
7206	12-nothing.
7207	Marshall.
7208	-  Marshall. - Zitch dog, blue Suburban.
7209	Damn it!
7210	18-nothing.
7211	Then Marshall, who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog,
7212	got us totally lost.
7213	Where the hell are we?!
7214	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.
7215	I think you skipped something.
7216	Really? Seems impossible.
7217	Hey, we got some time.
7218	What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know?
7219	Robert Frost.
7220	Doesn't seem like a smart idea.
7221	Too late.
7222	I'm taking this exit.
7223	Who's not fun enough now, Karen?
7224	Then we got lost.
7225	Where the hell are we?!
7226	- I'm pulling over. - No, keep driving.
7227	We're almost out of gas, and we might not even be on a road anymore.
7228	It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days.
7229	Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water.
7230	- Nah, I threw them out. - What?!
7231	No food or drink in the Fiero.
7232	No food or drink in the F...? You haven't washed your sheets since...
7233	Thus began the longest night of our lives.
7234	Pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid.
7235	Marshall...
7236	there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days.
7237	If I die first, do whatever you need to survive.
7238	Eat my flesh.
7239	Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever.
7240	Thanks, Ted.
7241	You're a good friend.
7242	And if I die first, you just leave my body alone.
7243	What?
7244	I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me.
7245	Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out.
7246	But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't.
7247	Wasn't an easy decision.
7248	This is all because of your insane no-food rule.
7249	It's perfectly rational.
7250	Hey! My spectacles!
7251	Hey.
7252	I know we're low on gas,
7253	but can we turn on the heat for just a minute?
7254	Okay.
7255	D ude...
7256	I hate to say this...
7257	but it's so cold...
7258	there's only one way that we're gonna make it through this night.
7259	- We should've kept driving. - Come on, Marshall.
7260	No. No. We might die now.
7261	I may never see Lily again.
7262	I never told anybody this, but...
7263	I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl.
7264	If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her.
7265	I'm sorry about your spectacles.
7266	That's okay.
7267	They were decorative.
7268	Hey, Marshall.
7269	Y eah?
7270	Are you still thinking about Lily?
7271	Yeah.
7272	Please stop.
7273	And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere.
7274	But funny thing...
7275	Hey. You lovers better just keep on driving.
7276	- Zitch dog! - Damn it!
7277	You said you were gonna marry me that long ago?
7278	That is so sweet.
7279	That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.
7280	With privileges, from the sound of it.
7281	E riksen.
7282	Wow.
7283	Looks like he really needs a hug.
7284	Ted.
7285	He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again.
7286	And even then, there's no guarantee.
7287	Well, it's a pretty old car.
7288	Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life,
7289	but it's really mostly machine at this point.
7290	I know that it's a lot of money,
7291	but it's my Fiero, you know?
7292	I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job,
7293	and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit.
7294	- How dare you... - Hey.
7295	I've been through so much in that car.
7296	The suicidal cat.
7297	Hitchhiking Waldo.
7298	The homeless guy who broke in through the window
7299	and threw up all over the backseat.
7300	Lily, don't.
7301	Be strong. Do not go all "prisoner's dilemma" on me.
7302	The car's on its deathbed, Robin. I have to clear my conscience.
7303	Guys, what are you talking about?
7304	Okay. Shortly after we met Robin,
7305	she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place.
7306	An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long.
7307	I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule.
7308	But Thai food, Lily.
7309	Pad Yum Mao.
7310	Tom Kai Gah.
7311	Thai See Ran.
7312	Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious.
7313	Okay. Here's what we'll do.
7314	We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it,
7315	very carefully drive it back here with the windows open,
7316	and he'll never know.
7317	Wow, these brakes are really sensitive.
7318	Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me!
7319	This and the difference between "affect" and "effect" are the only two things
7320	he's really serious about.
7321	- Lily, it's gonna be fine. - No, it's not.
7322	Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do?
7323	- Oh, God, oh...! - Shut up!
7324	Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking.
7325	Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage.
7326	Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts--
7327	the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up.
7328	Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai.
7329	You mentioned cigars.
7330	There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them.
7331	Hand me those chopsticks.
7332	Hey, how about some tunes?
7333	Oh, great song.
7334	These cigars aren't helping at all.
7335	Yeah. This was a terrible idea.
7336	Now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here.
7337	The broken windows?
7338	We had to make it look realistic.
7339	Why did you break two of them?
7340	It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try.
7341	Can't believe this whole time it was you guys.
7342	I've been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy.
7343	Marshall, I'm so sorry, but sharing that secret--
7344	that's when Robin and I became best friends.
7345	Wow. What a special car.
7346	So, can I crush it into a little cube yet?
7347	I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
7348	Come on, Marshall.
7349	This is your Fiero.
7350	You know the right thing to do here.
7351	Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?
7352	Love it?
7353	Hold on a second.
7354	Love it?
7355	I hate it!
7356	What? Why?
7357	Why? Why?
7358	Why?!
7359	- Why?! - Let me tell it.
7360	It was last year during the transit strike.
7361	- Hey. - Hey.
7362	Uh, is Marshall around?
7363	I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride.
7364	Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys.
7365	Hey! Why don't you drive me?
7366	It'll be like a total road trip.
7367	To Queens?
7368	Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.
7369	Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so.
7370	Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel.
7371	- See you later. - Wait!
7372	You know how to drive, right?
7373	What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving.
7374	Hitting the road.
7375	Cruising the lanes.
7376	And braking.
7377	Honking. Love it.
7378	Except for lady drivers.
7379	Don't get me started on lady drivers.
7380	- Which pedal's the gas? - Trick question.
7381	- No, it's not. - Yes, it is.
7382	- No, it's not. - Middle, left, right?
7383	I never learned how to drive!
7384	I grew up in the city. I never had a chance.
7385	Well, guess what?
7386	You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you.
7387	Barney Stinson, buckle up.
7388	This isn't right.
7389	God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.
7390	Relax. You're doing great.
7391	Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.
7392	Dude, a dog.
7393	Zitch dog, yes! 1-nothing.
7394	What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted.
7395	Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.
7396	Which? Which one's the break again?
7397	- The left one. - Left. Oh, man, left.
7398	- I'm totally blanking. - Make the Ls.
7399	Oh, we're not going to make it.
7400	Why did you just turn on the radio?
7401	I don't know why I turned on the radio!
7402	We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted.
7403	Relax. You're being crazy.
7404	- Help me, Ted! I'm being serious. - Stop, drop and roll.
7405	Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!
7406	I can't move.
7407	I can't... I can't feel my...
7408	Wait.
7409	Wait.
7410	We're okay.
7411	- We're okay. - We're okay.
7412	It's a miracle, Ted!
7413	Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car.
7414	Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he...
7415	hummina-hummina-hummina-hummina.
7416	I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap.
7417	But fate...
7418	fate gave me a second chance.
7419	And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander.
7420	So I decided from that moment on
7421	to continue living life to its fullest.
7422	So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.
7423	True story.
7424	Guys.
7425	This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us.
7426	Friendships were made.
7427	Adventures had. Horrors faced.
7428	That's why we have to get rid of it.
7429	- Yes! - What?
7430	It's lived a great life and it deserves to die with dignity.
7431	But 200,000...
7432	But that's life. You know?
7433	You never end up where you thought you wanted to be.
7434	I'm not helping the environment.
7435	Ted's not a philosopher.
7436	Lily's not not a world-famous artist.
7437	Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour.
7438	Robin, I'm sure, has also experienced disappointment in her life.
7439	Maybe?
7440	And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles.
7441	It's okay. You know?
7442	Those are old dreams.
7443	We'll get a new car and we'll fill that one up with new memories.
7444	And that'll be the car we had when we were first married.
7445	When we owned our first house.
7446	Maybe even the first car our four kids remember.
7447	That's so sweet.
7448	The first car our two kids remember.
7449	I would like to say good-bye.
7450	You know what?
7451	This Fiero, it's effected all our lives.
7452	- Affected. - That's what I said.
7453	Just making sure.
7454	Got us all a lot of places.
7455	I mean maybe it's time we return the favor.
7456	This Fiero should have made it to 200,000.
7457	So, let's get it out that door.
7458	And we'll push it the last .7 miles.
7459	It'd do the same for us.
7460	Hey, geniuses.
7461	The back wheels are on blocks. That car ain't going anywhere.
7462	- Close enough! - Close enough!
7463	And so Marshall said good-bye to his Fiero.
7464	And as the car's final gift to us all,
7465	the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights.
7466	Arrivederci, Fiero!
7467	You  were the freaking giving tree of cars.
7468	May you rust in peace.
7469	Rot in hell, devil steed.
7470	And what better friend is there than that?
7471	Bro. Have you heard this new song?
7472	I just got the cassingle.
7473	Put it in.
7474	I am never going to get sick of this song.
7475	Never, ever, never, never, ever.
7476	Yeah!
7477	Kids, in the spring of 2007, everything was great between me and Robin.
7478	So we decided to try and make it even better.
7479	We decided to move in together.
7480	So, I can have the moving truck here by 8:00 am.
7481	Does that sound good to everybody?
7482	By the way, what are you guys doing with Ted's room?
7483	'Cause if you need help with the rent, I'll take it.
7484	Why would you want to live with us?
7485	I don't call what you guys do "living."
7486	Here's the deal, I need a room closer to the bar.
7487	It takes me exactly 23 minutes
7488	to get a girl from the bar back to my apartment.
7489	A lot can go wrong in 23 minutes.
7490	This is going to be so hot.
7491	She's paying.
7492	I swear, if he doesn't call me back,
7493	I'm going to go through with this.
7494	Please hurry, sir.
7495	I want to do dirty stuff with you.
7496	Stuff I won't let him do.
7497	Every red light run is an extra $20.
7498	Baby?
7499	Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It was all my fault.
7500	I am so drunk.
7501	When I'm this drunk, I go crazy!
7502	I bet you do.
7503	Check this out.
7504	What up NYPD?
7505	So close.
7506	See? If I had a room here all I have to do is get them upstairs.
7507	Come on, guys. It'll be great!
7508	We'll come in after you guys are asleep
7509	and I'll be gone before you wake up.
7510	So, you get to have sex and we get to wake some skanky girl up in the morning
7511	and kick her out?
7512	God, Lily.
7513	Some guy just told her that he loved her then pretended to go to the bathroom
7514	and never came back you can't make her a cup of coffee?
7515	Real nice.
7516	I put all your heavy jackets in this box marked "winter."
7517	And all your colorful sweaters in this box marked "Bill Cosby."
7518	Make fun, but America loved that guy for a reason.
7519	Wow!
7520	Almost done.
7521	Not so fast.
7522	Take your sword.
7523	Wow.
7524	- End of an era. - Yeah.
7525	It's a bummer to break up the set, but you're going to need that sword.
7526	It's true-- my building is infested with dragons.
7527	Looks like our little boy is finally moving out.
7528	It seems like just yesterday he was a cute little freshmen.
7529	Discovering Reggae and ultimate Frisbee.
7530	He did it later than the other kids but we never pushed him.
7531	We knew he'd get there.
7532	You haven't moved in yet, have you?
7533	Good. You guys have to take this quiz.
7534	I found it in a magazine.
7535	It's called the "Are you ready to move in together?" quiz.
7536	Well, if it's anything like you're "Are you wearing panties" quiz,
7537	I'm out.
7538	Question one,
7539	Ted, "Do you want to move in with Robin?"
7540	Mm. Yes.
7541	Oh, you got the first one wrong.
7542	The answer is "no," you secretly want to be single
7543	and hang out with your awesome friend Barney."
7544	Question two.
7545	Robin, "Do you think you can score a hotter guy than Ted?"
7546	Correct. The answer was awkward silence.
7547	Question three, "Did I just make up this quiz to prove a point?"
7548	Yes.
7549	Yes, I did.
7550	Really? You mean it's not from Old Yellow Legal Pad Magazine?
7551	So? We all agree?
7552	We move Ted's stuff back up here?
7553	Mm... no. We're still moving in together.
7554	Why? This is crazy.
7555	Ted you're throwing your life away. This girl is blinding you.
7556	With her shiny hair and her boobed shaped boobs.
7557	This is bad for you, too, you know.
7558	How are you going to feel when he sees you without any makeup?
7559	I'm not wearing makeup right now.
7560	Holy crap, you're beautiful.
7561	All right then, how will you feel when you can't sneak the occasional cigarette?
7562	Oh, come on, Robin doesn't smoke.
7563	Wait, do you?
7564	Of course not. Why?
7565	Don't tell me how to live my life!
7566	Ted, I can't let you do this.
7567	Come on. This is happening.
7568	So instead of fighting it why, why don't you just help?
7569	- You want me to help you? - Yeah.
7570	Okay, Ted.
7571	I'll help you.
7572	Can't believe we actually got him to take a box down.
7573	Maybe he's finally getting on board.
7574	Where's the truck?
7575	Where's Barney?
7576	Wait for it.
7577	I can't believe this! Everything I own in the world is in there.
7578	Except for this box of pot lids.
7579	And the sword.
7580	I'm going to kill him. I swear to God I'm going to kill him!
7581	Right. Maybe I'll just hold on to that. For now.
7582	Marshall, we live alone.
7583	This is so great!
7584	We can finally do all the things we always said we wanted to do if we lived alone.
7585	Oh, I know what I want to start with.
7586	So, here we are, right?
7587	Sitting around the apartment naked.
7588	- Awesome. - Yep.
7589	It's not as awesome as I thought it would be.
7590	- My butt itches. - I'm cold.
7591	I noticed.
7592	Yeah, like you're one to talk, Pointy.
7593	Barney, I don't know if you got my other 47 messages,
7594	but if my stuff isn't here within the hour I'm calling the cops.
7595	This is the last time I'm calling you.
7596	Because my charger's in the back of the truck.
7597	Don't worry, it's Barney. He'll bring the stuff back.
7598	No, it's just... I was really looking forward to settling in, you know?
7599	Maybe setting up my TV.
7600	Watching a movie in bed.
7601	What?
7602	Do we really want a TV in the bedroom?
7603	I thought we did.
7604	I'm not sure that we do.
7605	Well, where else would we put my TV?
7606	We could just put it in our storage unit in the basement.
7607	But wouldn't we miss my TV?
7608	- Would we? - Yes, we would.
7609	We've had that TV for a long time
7610	and we would feel more at home if it were setup in our bedroom.
7611	- We need wine, don't we? - Yes, we do.
7612	Should we, um, move this to the bedroom?
7613	Why?
7614	Ted doesn't live here anymore.
7615	We can do it wherever we want.
7616	You know what else?
7617	We don't have to be quiet anymore.
7618	We can be as loud as we want.
7619	Okay, I think we need to lay down some ground rules.
7620	Just because we can be loud doesn't mean we have to be loud.
7621	And although it might turn you on,
7622	you screaming, "I'm the best," doesn't do much for me.
7623	Well, it's a lot better than yelling, "Ted's not here," over and over again.
7624	Well, at least what I said is true.
7625	Well, that was unnecessary.
7626	Well, since I only have one box I figure I might as well unpack it.
7627	Mm, where do you think we should put it?
7628	Well, unless you have a separate pot lid room, I was thinking the cupboard.
7629	What?
7630	Uh, the thing is my kitchen is kind of small.
7631	And, um, I already have a bunch of pot lids
7632	and mine come with pots, so...
7633	You're saying there's no way to make room for the single box of stuff
7634	I try to move into our place?
7635	Well, why don't you just take it down to the...
7636	Do not say storage space.
7637	I was going to say Dumpster.
7638	Damn it, Robin, this is all I have left in the world--
7639	eight pot lids and a sword.
7640	Yeah, about the sword.
7641	Hello.
7642	Put on the suit, Mr. Mosby.
7643	Barney, I know it's you. Where's my stuff?
7644	It's not me.
7645	If you want to see your precious possessions again,
7646	put on the suit.
7647	What suit?
7648	Ding-dong. Oh, what's that? The doorbell.
7649	That's the suit I'm talking about.
7650	I haven't gotten to the door yet.
7651	Oh, okay, let me know when you get there.
7652	Okay, I opened it. And there's a suit there.
7653	That's the suit I'm talking about.
7654	- Barney.... - This isn't Barney.
7655	But I hear that guy's awesome.
7656	All right. Listen very carefully.
7657	You will get your stuff back if you are able to complete a series of challenges.
7658	Number one, put on the suit.
7659	Number two, meet me at McClaren's in an hour.
7660	How will I know who to look for since we've never met?
7661	I look like Barney.
7662	Oh, hey, Ted.
7663	Suit and sneakers.
7664	A little Ellen DeGeneres but you pull it off.
7665	I don't have any other shoes because you stole them along
7666	with everything else I own in the world.
7667	Where's the truck, Barney?
7668	Barney.
7669	People's whose trucks I'm not holding for ransom call me Barney.
7670	I think you should call me The Commodore.
7671	- I'm not calling you... - You're not getting your stuff back.
7672	Can I please have my stuff back...
7673	The Commodore?
7674	No.
7675	Here's the deal, Ted, you're my bro.
7676	And you're about to become a henpecked, beaten down, shell of a man.
7677	So tonight, we are going to have one last awesome night together as bros.
7678	It's a bro-ing away party.
7679	A special bro-casion.
7680	A bro-choice rally.
7681	Bro-time at the Apollo.
7682	Oh, bro me.
7683	Well, so what do I have to do?
7684	No, it's not what you have to do, it's what you want to do,
7685	and you want to have a good time
7686	before you go take Fun Ted out back and shoot him.
7687	So... first thing on the docket...
7688	- get me that girl's number. - Absolutely not.
7689	Mm. That's too bad.
7690	Hey, hypothetical question: if I was all your stuff,
7691	would I rather be at the bottom of the East River or The Hudson?
7692	Hey, look, world's strongest man is on.
7693	Ooh, it's the one where Lou Ferrigno pulls the bus
7694	from the Partridge family with his teeth.
7695	It's the best one. Hey, Ted, get in...
7696	- We live alone. - Yay.
7697	Well, I win.
7698	You need to give my friend your phone number.
7699	Wow, I really didn't think Lou Ferrigno could pull that bus.
7700	Are you sure this is live? It looks pretty old.
7701	Yeah, that's 'cause the, uh, TV is old.
7702	So, I'll, uh, call you tomorrow?
7703	Yeah. Um, not too early. I have church.
7704	You were impressive, buddy.
7705	Nice work. All right, next challenge.
7706	No. No next challenge. Look, this is my first night living with Robin.
7707	She's probably pissed I'm spending it out with you.
7708	This might be our last hurrah, my little friend.
7709	Marshall, I am gonna cook you the best dinner of your life.
7710	How would you like a...
7711	one-egg omelet with some ketchup and film?
7712	Guess Ted's the one who did the shopping.
7713	Ooh, look, a microwave pizza!
7714	Guess the microwave was Ted's, too.
7715	Yeah.
7716	So were all the towels.
7717	Turns out that everything that was useful in this apartment was Ted's.
7718	Everything that was a Foghat poster we bought ironically in college was mine.
7719	Marshall.
7720	Yeah, baby?
7721	I miss Ted.
7722	Is it too soon to call him?
7723	No, we shouldn't.
7724	I don't want to interrupt his first night living with Robin.
7725	Ha, nice shooting.
7726	You know, if we win this one it's free onion rings at the Intergalactic Snack Shack.
7727	What a bargain.
7728	We only had to spend 20 bucks a game.
7729	Admit it, you're having fun.
7730	Maybe.
7731	I mean, it was pretty funny when that little girl fell over that space barrel.
7732	Nice... We win.
7733	Oh, walk of shame, walk of game-- what up?
7734	Okay. Let's go one more.
7735	- I don't know. - You know you want to.
7736	All right, let's do it-- I just got to call Robin real quick.
7737	Oh, so that's what it's gonna be like from now on?
7738	No. Okay, okay. You call your old lady and ask permission to have fun.
7739	Me, I will be at the Snack Shack eating our victory onion rings Han style.
7740	Solo.
7741	- Hey, Ted. - Hey, sweetie listen,
7742	I'm really sorry but I'm gonna be pretty late, so don't wait up.
7743	Oh, it's totally fine. You do what you got to do.
7744	Thanks. You're the best. I love you.
7745	I love you, too. Bye.
7746	Hey, sorry about that. Thanks for holding.
7747	Um, so if you could go ahead and cancel my subscription to Guns and Ammo,
7748	that would be great.
7749	No, it's a great magazine. Really great.
7750	They've printed three of my letters.
7751	It's just that my boyfriend is moving in
7752	and he kind of doesn't approve of the whole gun thing.
7753	A free hand grenade phone?
7754	You know what? Let me give you my work address.
7755	I did it, baby!
7756	I got beer. I got food.
7757	We don't need Ted anymore.
7758	I am the provider of this apartment now,
7759	and I have provided!
7760	"Provode"? Provided.
7761	Anyway, I got us everything we need.
7762	Could you toss me the toilet paper?
7763	Be right back, baby. Sit tight.
7764	Hey, I got to admit, um... I didn't think I would, but, uh...
7765	I had a really good time tonight.
7766	You're a good friend, Barney.
7767	Hey, man, why don't you, uh...
7768	why don't you tell me where my truck is.
7769	No, I don't think so.
7770	Where's my truck?!
7771	Do you know why I haven't given you any of your possessions back yet?
7772	Uh, because you're Admiral Jerk of the British Royal Douchery?
7773	Because you don't want them back.
7774	You could've left at any time tonight, but you didn't, Ted.
7775	Why is that?
7776	Because I didn't want to go back to Robin's without my stuff.
7777	False. You know what I think?
7778	I think you spent one day with her and it already sucked.
7779	I think you didn't like being there, she didn't like having you there
7780	and you both realized that you made a huge mistake.
7781	And that's why you spent your first night living with Robin
7782	out playing laser tag with me.
7783	And that's why three seconds ago
7784	you didn't call it "my place" or "our place" or "home,"
7785	you called it "Robin's."
7786	You know what?
7787	You can keep my stuff.
7788	- Hey. - Hey, did you get the truck back?
7789	No.
7790	Why not? What happened?
7791	Oh, he pissed me off so much, I left.
7792	Anyway, I just wanted to come back here, space out and watch a movie.
7793	Do you anything that wasn't made by John Woo?
7794	Why, do you?
7795	You know, forget the movie. I just want to sit.
7796	What?
7797	It's just I eat at that table.
7798	Fine, I'll take my shoes off.
7799	You know, why don't you just throw me down in the storage space
7800	where you have room for me.
7801	- Ted, come on. - No, you come on.
7802	I had to jump through hoops all night for Barney
7803	and then it took me an hour to get home because his place
7804	is so far away from the bar.
7805	- Oh, my God. - What?
7806	I know where Barney put my truck.
7807	Let's go back to my place.
7808	I bet you my place is closer.
7809	Here we are.
7810	You live in the loading dock behind the bar?
7811	I don't live here, baby. This is just my ride.
7812	No, no, no, no. I'm not getting into any van,
7813	I've seen Silence of the Lambs.
7814	Oh, my God. We're drinking champagne in the back of a moving van.
7815	Why, yes, Sara. Yes, we are.
7816	Those other Rockettes who called you slow are crazy.
7817	Oh, my God. I knew it. You're kidnapping me.
7818	- Help! Help! - No, no, no, no.
7819	I can explain.
7820	Hello?
7821	Enjoying the ride?
7822	Ted? Ted, you let us out of here. You let us out of here this instant!
7823	This isn't Ted.
7824	But I hear that guy's awesome.
7825	So I took Sara home and I took Barney to a bar near his apartment.
7826	Apparently, that strategy had never occurred to him.
7827	That poor girl must've been so confused.
7828	Yeah.
7829	Well, at least Barney learned a valuable lesson.
7830	You do not want to get scissor kicked in the groin by a Rockette.
7831	So, uh, I guess we should get you unpacked.
7832	Yeah.
7833	Yeah, I guess we should.
7834	Lily... deep within the Amazonian rainforest,
7835	there is a type of tree that only grows around the body of an existing tree.
7836	It cannot survive without this tree.
7837	It is supported...
7838	by this tree.
7839	Lily, we are that tree.
7840	- The inside tree or the outside tree? - The outside tree.
7841	- Shouldn't there be three trees? - You and I are one tree.
7842	Okay, look, Lily, the point is that we grew around Ted
7843	and without him, we're slowly dying.
7844	What do we do?
7845	I think we can marry each other.
7846	But we also have to marry Ted.
7847	I'll tell you right now, my Dad is not gonna pay for that wedding.
7848	Ted!
7849	What are you doing here?
7850	Robin and I aren't gonna move in together after all.
7851	What happened?
7852	I thought we decided we were ready?
7853	I know.
7854	How did we come to that again?
7855	I don't remember. We were fighting?
7856	- It's all so blurry. - Yeah.
7857	The "let's move in together" sex was pretty amazing.
7858	I know.
7859	I did that thing with no hands I normally need both to do.
7860	You know... I'm really happy with you.
7861	I really happy with you. The way things are.
7862	Maybe we shouldn't mess with that.
7863	I don't know that we should.
7864	Hey... I hear the "let's not move in together" sex is pretty incredible.
7865	Let's go back to my place.
7866	- Ooh, thank you. - You're welcome.
7867	- No, thank you. - You'll be very happy.
7868	Look, I know you guys are really excited about having the place to yourself.
7869	Until after the wedding, I mean, if it's not too much of an imposition...
7870	God, this feels so right.
7871	Never leave us again.
7872	Guys, Robin's down in the truck and there's actually a lot of boxes,
7873	so maybe we should...
7874	Do we have time for this?
7875	Ladies and gentlemen, I have in my hand a copy of tonight's Top Ten list.
7876	The category: top ten things I would've called my truck...
7877	It was never your truck.
7878	...if Ted hadn't been a jerk and given it back.
7879	It was a rental.
7880	Number ten, "The Winne-Bango."
7881	Number nine, "The Pick-Up Truck."
7882	Number eight, "The Ford Explore Her."
7883	Number seven, "The You Scream Truck."
7884	You Scream.
7885	Number six, "Feels On Wheels." Hello!
