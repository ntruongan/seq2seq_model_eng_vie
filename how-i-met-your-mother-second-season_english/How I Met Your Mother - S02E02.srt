1
00:00:00,718 --> 00:00:04,056
Marshall and Lily had been
together for nine wonderful years,

2
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:06,826
until she dumped him and
ran off to San Francisco.

3
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:10,211
The healing process
was taking a long time.

4
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:14,453
Then, one night,
he made a giant leap forward.

5
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:16,091
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

6
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:17,230
I'll walk you out.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,474
See ya.

8
00:00:22,764 --> 00:00:24,855
You just checked
out Robin's ass.

9
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:26,937
What? No! No, Barney, I was...

10
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:28,941
Dude, that's awesome.

11
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:32,034
You're finally forgetting
about that short redhead.

12
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:32,780
Lily.

13
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,975
Yes, Lily. Thank you. That was
going to drive me crazy all night.

14
00:00:35,985 --> 00:00:38,220
Hey, Ted, Marshall just checked
out your girlfriend's ass.

15
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:40,872
- I did not, Ted, I...
- That's awesome.

16
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:42,290
You're finally getting better.

17
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:44,171
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

18
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:47,610
Starting tonight,
I am going to teach you how to live.

19
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:49,592
Ted, you had your chance.
You're out; Marshall's in.

20
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:50,943
- Yes!
- Oh, God.

21
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:54,792
Marshall, being a single guy
in New York City is like...

22
00:00:55,616 --> 00:00:57,240
What's something
everybody likes?

23
00:00:57,255 --> 00:00:58,263
Candy.

24
00:00:58,277 --> 00:01:00,800
Yes, it's like being
in a candy store.

25
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:04,123
You just walk right in and
grab yourself some Whoppers.

26
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:08,101
Is Whoppers the best one?

28
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:09,193
Mounds.

29
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:10,523
Milk Duds.

30
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:12,171
Gobstoppers.

31
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:15,210
This went on for another hour;

32
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:16,693
I'll just skip to the end.

33
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:18,732
- Dubble Bubbles.
- Nice!

34
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,450
Marshall. We're doing this.

35
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:22,391
I am not taking
no for an answer.

36
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:23,671
Fine.

37
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:25,793
Hey, Robin.
Marshall checked out your ass.

38
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:27,341
Ted, what is wrong with you?

39
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:29,012
He checked out my ass.

40
00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:32,551
Hey, tell him thanks.
I felt like I was having a bad ass day.

41
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,521
Cool, see ya.

42
00:01:37,657 --> 00:01:39,132
Lily.

43
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,433
It is a great ass.

44
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:57,382
None of us had seen
Lily in three months.

45
00:01:57,396 --> 00:01:59,392
There were so many
unanswered questions,

46
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:01,012
so many things to say.

47
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:03,721
Your hair is adorable.

48
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,322
Meanwhile, Barney was taking
Marshall out to meet women

49
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,883
for the first time
since he was 17.

50
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:13,152
Hi. Have you met Marshall?

51
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:15,353
- Hi.
- Hi.

52
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:19,520
Look how sweaty my hands are.

53
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:22,981
It's weird, right? Uh, sweat?

54
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:26,960
Like, this smelly water
coming out of your skin.

55
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,700
It was nice meeting you.

56
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,462
I-I-I hate to interrupt,
but, uh,

57
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:35,351
do you like magic?

58
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,430
Um, I guess.

59
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:41,761
Oh, my God!

60
00:02:45,935 --> 00:02:48,481
Anyway, Marshall
here is awesome.

61
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:50,761
Salad in a bag? His idea.

62
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,693
Dude! You were
awesome last night.

63
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,410
You were charming,
you were funny,

64
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,163
you were totally
working that girl.

65
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,562
You went home with her.

66
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,420
Yes, I did.

67
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:03,723
But she told me that
if it wasn't for me,

68
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:05,263
you would have had
a shot with her,

69
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:08,122
so, in hypothetical terms,
you scored last night.

70
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:09,360
All right!

71
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:11,240
Hypothetical high five.

72
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:14,240
Nice.

73
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:16,580
All right.
Tonight, we're going to go to the bar...

74
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:19,330
Barney, no,
I am not going out with you ever again.

75
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:22,142
Come on! I'll,
I'll teach you all of my strategies.

76
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:22,933
Oh, really?

77
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:25,081
My favorite, number seven:

78
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:26,990
create a mystery
about yourself.

79
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,772
That way, they become so intrigued, they
have to hang out with you all night.

80
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:32,823
Oh, come on,
does that really work?

81
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:35,840
Maybe it does,
and maybe it doesn't.

82
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:40,950
Damn it, that's intriguing.
Okay, I'm in.

83
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:46,100
- I have something you've got to hear.
- You will not believe what just happened.

84
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:47,713
You go first.

85
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:51,621
I found a 1939d
penny on the subway.

86
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:54,603
Just imagine the kind of history
this little copper guy...

87
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:56,262
Lily's back in town.

88
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:58,902
And you let me go first?

89
00:03:58,916 --> 00:03:59,881
Have you seen her?

90
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:03,370
Yeah. I actually went
apartment-hunting with her today.

91
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:04,941
How's she doing?

92
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,691
You're not going to like it.

93
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,213
I am doing great.

94
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:11,360
This summer, best thing ever!

95
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,130
San Francisco is so
happening right now.

96
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:15,691
She's  happy?!

97
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:19,011
Marshall had the worst summer
of his life, and she's happy.

98
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:23,442
Yeah, and I suppose her art program
was all fulfilling or whatever.

99
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:27,161
Oh. The art program--
best thing ever.

100
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:29,090
Oh, my God.

101
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:30,971
This is your best work.

102
00:04:30,985 --> 00:04:34,141
In all my years teaching,
I've never seen anything so...

103
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,841
Needless to say, this is art.

104
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:42,182
I can't teach you anything.

105
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:47,640
But the best part of S.F.--

106
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:49,832
Oh, that's what we
call San Francisco--

107
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:50,971
the people.

108
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:53,232
Even just riding around
on the bus all summer.

109
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:56,590
It was like a human tapestry.

110
00:04:56,715 --> 00:04:58,232
Hi, I'm Mike.

111
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:01,312
I'm a Buddhist monk slash
adventure-traveler writer.

112
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,863
I'm Paula.
I sing in a punk band for children.

113
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,191
Yeah.

114
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,001
I'm  Dan, I'm a neurosurgeon.

115
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:10,231
You are stunning, by the way.

116
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:15,083
Wow. I'm so happy for you.

117
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:17,670
Oh, she's such a...

118
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:22,722
After what she did to Marshall,
she should come back here devastated,

119
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:26,481
crawling on all fours over the broken
glass of her own shame and regret.

120
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,820
You never chose sides.
I respect that.

121
00:05:28,837 --> 00:05:30,583
She's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

122
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:32,991
Unbelievable?
What's unbelievable?

123
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:34,350
Oh. Listen, Marshall.

124
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:38,301
Ted found a penny on the subway,
and it's old, and that's interesting.

125
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:42,952
Way to go.

126
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:48,691
Okay, first of all,
that is interesting.

127
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:50,163
Second, we have to tell him.

128
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:53,840
No, we don't. He's just starting to
get better, going out with Barney.

129
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:57,111
I mean, how do you think he's going to
feel when he hears Lily's moved on?

130
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:59,471
- She's moved on?
- It happens.

131
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:01,590
I've fallen out of love
faster than that before,

132
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:04,211
sometimes, boom,
with no warning whatsoever.

133
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:07,283
One day we're in love,
the next day, he's dead to me.

134
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:10,471
But we're great.

135
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:12,191
Honey.

136
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:17,660
Now, let's review Barney's
rules for mating without dating.

137
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:20,212
Lesson two, corollary five.

138
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:23,590
Make a beautiful woman feel
self-conscious and unattractive

139
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:24,961
and she'll be putty
in your hands.

140
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:27,422
Excellent.  Have you
chosen your entree?

141
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:30,282
I have.
Sweet brunette, eight o'clock.

142
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:32,061
Nine o'clock. Ten... thirty.

143
00:06:32,076 --> 00:06:33,830
She's walking to the bar.

144
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,674
- Her? Really?
- Yeah.

145
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:39,740
No, you're right.
Ambition is the enemy of success.

146
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:41,455
Okay. Hit it.

147
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:47,822
What's the matter, four eyes,
you got astigmatism or something?

148
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:49,750
I'm sorry,
I was trying to playfully disarm you,

149
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:51,230
but I just got out of
a long relationship.

150
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,471
I have no idea what I'm doing.

151
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:55,322
I'm Marshall.

152
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:57,602
Hi, Marshall. Amy.

153
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,491
Don't worry. I've been there.

154
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:00,971
Hold on.

155
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:03,150
Nice recovery.
I think it's working.

156
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:05,931
Um, Amy.
This is my friend, Barney.

157
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:07,813
Barney, this is Amy.

158
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:09,693
Hi, Barney. Nice to meet you.

159
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,142
Hi.

160
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:15,490
Amy, do you like... magic?

161
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:18,411
- I hate you.
- I am so sorry.

162
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:21,562
It's a sickness.
I'm the real victim here.

163
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:22,771
Twice.

164
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:26,553
Twice in a row, you took my candy.
That was my candy.

165
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:29,692
- I know, but tonight...
- No. Forget it.

166
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,182
You're such a jackass.

167
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:36,991
I thought you were
gonna call me a jerk.

168
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:40,570
All right, I'm sorry.
I will make it up to you.

169
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:43,520
Tonight, we'll go to a
college bar near NYU--

170
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:45,443
The Scorpion and the Toad.

171
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:48,773
I figure in a younger crowd you'll
seem more mature, more worldly

172
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:52,292
and, as a third-year
law student, more smarter.

173
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:58,721
Okay, but no magic.

174
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:03,010
How did you do that?

175
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:05,162
I'm taking a leak, dumb ass.

176
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:10,230
The next day, Robin and I went
apartment-hunting with aunt Lily.

177
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,912
But I need the freedom to
really chase my passion,

178
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,171
which was painting,
but now I think it's music

179
00:08:15,186 --> 00:08:17,080
or spoken word-- maybe both.

180
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,251
God! Isn't life amazing?

181
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,952
It is so great to see you, Ted.

182
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:24,933
I'm going to get the
key from the lockbox.

183
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:28,710
What?

184
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:31,490
She's miserable. She's realized
she's made a huge mistake.

185
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:33,900
Her and Marshall will be back
together in a week. I love it!

186
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,091
Um, no.
You just want Lily to be miserable.

187
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:37,382
The truth is, she's happy.

188
00:08:37,398 --> 00:08:39,421
Trust me.
I've known Lily for nine years.

189
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,683
Trust me. I'm a girl.

190
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,550
Yeah, but you're Canadian.

191
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:44,870
- Why do you always have to bring that up?
- You're our weird neighbors to the north.

192
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:49,012
- You bring it up every time.
- Five bucks says she still wants Marshall.

193
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,301
You're on.

194
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:51,820
Five American bucks.

195
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:53,482
Damn it.

196
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:55,851
Okay, so how do we get
the truth out of her.

197
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,772
Tequila. It's her weakness.

198
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,383
Three shots, she'll tell you
the truth about anything.

199
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:03,620
I hope this is my new home.

200
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:09,112
Yeah, I'm going to take
that first apartment.

201
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:12,290
Marshall Eriksen, suit up!

202
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:13,051
No way.

203
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,722
Yeah, you're good in that.

204
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:16,822
- Let's go.
- Wait.

205
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:18,631
Empty your pockets.

206
00:09:19,556 --> 00:09:20,872
Come on.

207
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:28,342
- Come on, let's...
- Sleeves.

208
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:31,380
- There is nothing in my...
- Oh, is that right?

209
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:40,081
Let's go.

210
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:44,672
- Behind my ear.
- There is nothing behind your...

211
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:52,892
Yeah, I'm in pre-law.
The workload's killing me, though.

212
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:56,293
Oh, tell me about it.
I'm third year at Columbia Law, so...

213
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:59,592
if the workload does kill you,
I can probably get a conviction.

214
00:10:00,628 --> 00:10:02,053
Yeah.

215
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:04,051
You must be majoring
in chemistry,

216
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:07,153
'cause what I'm picking
up between us is, uh...

217
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:10,431
College lesbian phase.

218
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:17,953
Listen, I got to go,
but it'd be great to see you again.

219
00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:20,271
Yes, it would.

220
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:22,592
It really would.

221
00:10:23,217 --> 00:10:25,763
Well, maybe I'll see
you here sometime.

222
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:28,631
Probably not.
I'm never here, so...

223
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:30,771
You know,
I do have a phone number.

224
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:32,392
Great.

225
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:34,513
Nice.

226
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:36,962
- Hi, I'm Barney.
- Oh, no.

227
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:40,751
Do you... mind giving my friend 
your phone number?

228
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:42,442
Sure.

229
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,763
Whoo!

230
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:48,592
I did it!
I got a girl's phone number.

231
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:51,041
Oh, and her handwriting
is so cute, look.

232
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:52,672
Oh, I'm gonna take her
out for Chinesr food

233
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:54,191
and then maybe we'll
walk through the park.

234
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:56,511
It'll be so... what?

235
00:10:56,745 --> 00:10:59,721
Sorry, buddy,
I'm taking this one, too.

236
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:06,043
I'll kill you!

237
00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:08,510
And then, I discovered this area,
North Beach.

238
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:10,303
Best beach ever!

239
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:13,651
Oh, I've been blabbering
on about my summer.

240
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:15,373
How are you guys doing?

241
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:17,092
And hey, how's Marshall?

242
00:11:17,105 --> 00:11:18,990
- Give me the card!
- I'm not giving you any card.

243
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,442
- I swear...!
- You are not getting...!

244
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:21,720
Terrific.

245
00:11:21,736 --> 00:11:24,630
That is so good to hear.
Oh, hold on.

246
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:27,361
This could be about
the apartment.

247
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,950
Okay, we're way
past truth-telling-Lilly

248
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:32,272
and about to
hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998-Lilly

249
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:34,212
and I'm not cleaning
that up again.

250
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:37,331
So, congratulations, you win.

251
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:39,371
She's happy.

252
00:11:39,385 --> 00:11:41,160
I didn't get it.

253
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:43,680
That first apartment, I...

254
00:11:43,697 --> 00:11:45,813
I waited too long and...

255
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:48,280
somebody else got it.

256
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,512
Interesting.

257
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:55,602
Wow, Lily, you, uh...

258
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:58,551
seem to be having a pretty strong
reaction on losing an apartment.

259
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:01,590
I wonder if it's because it reminds
you of something else you lost

260
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:03,872
because  you couldn't commit.

261
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:06,701
No, Lily,
you're crying over the crown molding

262
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:09,962
and the real hardwood floors.
There's no deeper meaning.

263
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:12,951
Right, Lily?
Just quit crying and tell him.

264
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:18,952
The apartment is a
metaphor for Marshall.

265
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:23,970
- Stop it!
- You don't want to see...

266
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,492
- ..what I'm like when I'm angry.
- It's my card!

267
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:27,043
Stop! Hold on!

268
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,771
If we can't settle
this like gentlemen,

269
00:12:28,788 --> 00:12:29,920
then no one gets the number.

270
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:32,762
- No! Stop the cab.
- Wha...?

271
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,120
No, wait. Come on. Marshall!

272
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,382
81st and First, please.

273
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:45,113
Ah, she does have
cute handwriting.

274
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:47,563
The thing about a hangover

275
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:50,011
is that everyone has
their own special remedy.

276
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,251
Morning, guys.
What can I get you?

277
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:52,513
Shh!

278
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:55,571
Bring me the dirtiest,
greasiest tuna melt you got.

279
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:57,272
And a milkshake.

280
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:58,891
For you, sir?

281
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,181
Gravy.

282
00:13:02,307 --> 00:13:04,733
You want that
gravy on something?

283
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:06,512
Surprise me.

284
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:10,552
I'd take you with gravy if my
boyfriend wasn't sitting right here.

285
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:13,021
Just  kidding. I'm good.

286
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:16,501
What are you so chirpy about?

287
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:18,570
She's still drunk
from last night.

288
00:13:18,585 --> 00:13:20,443
I don't think so.

289
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,643
Whoo!

290
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:27,061
Look, if you want
Marshall back so bad,

291
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:29,530
how come it took you two
days to even ask about him?

292
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:33,220
I was dying to ask.
I was just trying to play it cool.

293
00:13:33,238 --> 00:13:34,540
But really...

294
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:36,352
But it's good, I mean,
work is great...

295
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,350
Come on, say something about Marshall.
Where's Marshall?

296
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:40,043
How's Marshall?
What's Marshall doing right now?

297
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:42,481
Shut up and talk about Marshall.
Shut up and talk about Marshall.

298
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:44,820
Shut up and talk about Marshall.
Marshall, Marshall,

299
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:47,290
Marshall, Marshall...
I've got to ask!

300
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:49,493
And hey, how's Marshall?

301
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:51,352
It was such an awful summer.

302
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:53,872
I just wanted to get
back here and see him.

303
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:56,043
But I thought your
summer was great.

304
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:58,070
Not exactly.

305
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,472
Oh, my God.

306
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:03,172
This is you best work?

307
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:08,163
In all my years teaching,
I've never seen anything so needless.

308
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:11,950
To say this is... art...

309
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:15,573
I can't teach you anything.

310
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:20,811
So all those interesting
people you met on the bus?

311
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,451
Yeah, um...

312
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:24,463
Hi. I'm Mike.

313
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:28,271
I'm a Buddhist monk slash
adventure travel writer.

314
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:33,013
I'm Paula.
I sing in a punk band for children.

315
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:39,340
Hey,  I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon.
You are stunning, by the way.

316
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:43,003
I never got in touch because
I was too embarrassed.

317
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,713
I screwed everything up.

318
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:47,790
I have no job,
no place to live.

319
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:50,841
I lost the love of my life.

320
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:54,333
I know I have no right
to ask this, but...

321
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:56,812
do you think Marshall
would take me back?

322
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:58,171
In a heartbeat.

323
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:01,852
If you called him up, yeah,
he'd take you back with open arms.

324
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:04,940
Wow. So maybe 
I should call him.

325
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,410
Maybe.

326
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:09,453
No! This is... Ow!

327
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:11,792
Hold on.

328
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:14,212
Look, if you're going
to go back to him,

329
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:15,362
I don't want to hear
the word "maybe."

330
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:17,502
"Maybe" cannot be
in your vocabulary.

331
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,312
This breakup almost killed him.

332
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:21,673
And he cannot go
through it again.

333
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:26,702
So, unless you're absolutely certain,
stay the hell away from him.

334
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:32,853
This guy likes pennies.

335
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:36,672
Hi, Marshall.

336
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:38,842
No, go away.
I don't want to talk to you.

337
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:44,062
Okay, I know what I did a couple
nights back is in a moral gray area.

338
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:47,492
But the great news is,
she loved you.

339
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:49,720
If things had gone your way--
you'd gone out a couple times,

340
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:52,032
I think she definitely
would have had sex with you.

341
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:54,591
There's no "would" in sex.

342
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:59,791
You're right, I totally...
I'm just no good at this, Barney.

343
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:02,930
I'm good at being in a couple,
I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend.

344
00:16:02,946 --> 00:16:05,012
Being single-- forget it.

345
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:06,572
Come on, you can't give up now.

346
00:16:06,585 --> 00:16:08,841
What if I told you that
you could relive that night

347
00:16:08,857 --> 00:16:11,662
with the exact same conversations,
the exact same jokes

348
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:15,062
only this time,
you get her and I don't.

349
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:16,232
That's not possible.

350
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:17,693
Oh, but it is.

351
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:19,351
She has...

352
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:20,972
wait for it...

353
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:22,610
here it comes...

354
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:24,223
almost there...

355
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:26,192
an identical twin.

356
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,763
Yes!

357
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:29,933
A twin isn't the same person.

358
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:32,251
Of course it is.
What do you think identical means?

359
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:35,322
"Ident"-- same, "ical"-- person. 
Same person.

360
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:38,093
Hey, we could double date.

361
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:40,653
Fine.

362
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:43,810
But you have to promise me,
you're not going to steal my new twin,

363
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:48,190
and leave me with your old,
used-up twin.

364
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:49,902
Used-up?

365
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:52,700
They're a human being, 
Marshall.

366
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:56,600
So Uncle Marshall and
Uncle Barney went out

367
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:58,971
on a double date
with the twins.

368
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,073
How you doing?

369
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,870
Great. Amazing.
This is so much fun.

370
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:05,603
And I think me and the
girl are really clicking.

371
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,292
You are, you definitely are.

372
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:09,451
Listen, you're going
to have to leave now.

373
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:11,293
I just talked with the twins,
and get this,

374
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:14,291
I'm going home
with both of them.

375
00:17:14,306 --> 00:17:17,511
Yeah. That's happening.

376
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:20,681
It is impossible that you're
doing this to me again.

377
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:23,141
But they're twins.

378
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:25,412
You-- you said to me
that being single

379
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:27,122
would be like being
in a candy store.

380
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:28,992
Well, it's not,
it's not like a candy store.

381
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,103
It's a lawless,
postapocalyptic wasteland.

382
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:34,080
- I may be your best friend...
- Actually Ted's my best friend.

383
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:37,832
But in this world,
it's every hombre for himself.

384
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:39,873
That's what being single is.

385
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:41,842
And after nine
years in captivity,

386
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:43,941
that is the single greatest lesson 
I can teach you 

387
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:46,052
about surviving in the wild.

388
00:17:46,068 --> 00:17:47,862
Now, if you'll excuse me...

389
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:49,950
I have two unique breasts

390
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:52,893
and two duplicates
waiting for me.

391
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:59,800
Oh, bad news--
Marshall got food poisoning.

392
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:00,913
- What?
- Oh, no.

393
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:03,051
That's too bad.
I really liked him.

394
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:07,360
Yeah. Well, I guess 
we're just a threesome tonight.

395
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:20,703
Lily, what are you doing here?

396
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:23,980
Oh, I was just walking by.
I wasn't...

397
00:18:24,018 --> 00:18:26,802
Oh, you mean New York?
My program ended.

398
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:29,662
It was just great.
Just lots of fun...

399
00:18:29,677 --> 00:18:32,822
It was awful.
It was the worst mistake I ever made.

400
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:36,223
I'm so sorry,
Marshall, and... hello.

401
00:18:38,507 --> 00:18:41,482
Lily, this was the
worst summer of my life.

402
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,211
I know.
It was the worst summer of my life.

403
00:18:44,227 --> 00:18:47,243
It was the hardest thing that
I've ever had to go through.

404
00:18:48,415 --> 00:18:51,130
Can we please get
back together?

405
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,391
All that crap you
said to me about,

406
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:58,812
"we need to figure out
who we are outside of us,

407
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:01,762
and we need to learn to
do things on our own,"

408
00:19:02,637 --> 00:19:04,851
it broke my heart.

409
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,873
Three months ago,
you broke my heart.

410
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:13,821
Can we please get
back together?

411
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:17,150
Lily, you were right.

412
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:21,093
All that crap was right.

413
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:24,492
So, no.

414
00:19:24,938 --> 00:19:27,173
No, we can't get back together.

415
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:28,920
We shouldn't.

416
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:31,262
At least, not right now.

417
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,303
Wow.

418
00:19:35,598 --> 00:19:37,282
Okay.

419
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:40,303
Yeah.

420
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:43,413
Well...

421
00:19:45,406 --> 00:19:48,003
Will we still see each other?

422
00:19:48,477 --> 00:19:50,570
Yeah, yeah.

423
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:52,273
I think so.

424
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:55,523
I don't know.

425
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,003
This is all really new to me.

426
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,222
I just got out of a
long relationship.

427
00:20:07,488 --> 00:20:09,133
I like your hair.

428
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:11,191
Thanks.

429
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:15,133
I figured new city,
a different color...

430
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:17,073
# ...Wide open road #

431
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:20,450
# It was love to us #

432
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:23,551
# It was all that we had... #

433
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:27,700
And the pizza there,
worst pizza ever.

434
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:31,011
I'm so glad to be
back in New York.

435
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:36,150
Listen, if there's anything
I can do to even begin

436
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,730
to make things up to you...

437
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:43,841
Actually there may be something
that you can do for me,

438
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:47,342
but you can never
ever ask me why.

439
00:20:47,356 --> 00:20:50,562
So then I was promoted to
assistant ménage-er...

440
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:53,632
Manager-- why do
I keep doing that?

441
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:58,712
- Lily?
- You gave me chlamydia, you jerk.

442
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,481
So where was I?
Ah, yes, assistant ménage-er...

443
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:09,543
I did it again.
I can't believe it.

444
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:15,620
You gave my twin sister chlamydia.
You slime!

445
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:20,220
Wha... wait, I know magic.

446
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:26,210
Well played, Eriksen.

447
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:28,741
Well played.
