1
00:00:00,894 --> 00:00:03,507
Kids, when you reach your late
20s you might be surprised

2
00:00:03,517 --> 00:00:06,507
to discover you still don't
have life quite figured out.

3
00:00:06,517 --> 00:00:08,084
Like with Aunt Lily.

4
00:00:08,094 --> 00:00:10,197
Even though she was back
from San Francisco,

5
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:12,264
she was still on a
quest to find herself.

6
00:00:12,274 --> 00:00:15,415
It's just that all I've ever
done is teach kindergarten.

7
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:17,844
I want to get out there
and change the world.

8
00:00:17,854 --> 00:00:20,407
I want to find my passion.

9
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:22,081
And she did find it.

10
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:23,843
I'm going to be a life coach.

11
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:25,991
In fact,
she found it again and again.

12
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:28,653
I'm going to be a
marine biologist.

13
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:31,972
...slam poet.
...beekeeper!

14
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:34,802
Not a beekeeper.

15
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:37,680
Her newest lifelong dream?

16
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:39,810
Singing in a punk rock band.

17
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:41,593
What is she doing for
money through all this?

18
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:43,930
Oh, she's been waiting
tables at Big Wave Luau.

19
00:00:43,948 --> 00:00:45,530
Wait, you mean that
Hawaiian place

20
00:00:45,548 --> 00:00:47,750
where they wear those
embarrassing outfits?

21
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:49,560
No.

22
00:00:51,438 --> 00:00:53,452
Here she comes. Here she comes.

23
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:57,303
Welcome to Big Wave Luau.
May I tiki your drink order?

24
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:58,803
Aw, crap.

25
00:00:58,818 --> 00:01:00,130
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:02,223
Oh, hi, Lily.
We were just in the neighborhood,

27
00:01:02,237 --> 00:01:04,943
thought we'd get some lunch.
We didn't even know you'd be here.

28
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:09,352
What do you want?

29
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:11,300
Oh, I don't think that's
how you're supposed to greet

30
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:14,323
a customer at Big Wave Luau.

31
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:19,791
Aloha, island visitors.

32
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:23,393
The big wave brought
you to our humble luau.

33
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:27,391
For that, we thank you.
Or in my native tongue, mahalo.

34
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:31,373
I didn't catch your name.
Did you guys catch her name?

35
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:32,790
No.

36
00:01:32,805 --> 00:01:34,830
My name is Anuhea.

37
00:01:34,848 --> 00:01:36,851
It means cool and fragrant,

38
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:39,900
much like any of our
12 specialty drinks.

39
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:42,273
Robin, nothing to add?

40
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:45,090
No. Lily is my friend and I'm
not going to make fun of her

41
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:46,620
for trying to
follow her dreams.

42
00:01:46,637 --> 00:01:48,231
Thank you.

43
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:50,761
Although, you might want to
bring out the big Hawaiian drum

44
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,300
because I'm pretty sure
today's my birthday.

45
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:54,850
Birthday girl!

46
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:11,083
I have never needed beer
more than I do right now.

47
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:13,303
I thought you said your semester
was gonna be a piece of cake.

48
00:02:13,338 --> 00:02:15,692
I remember because you were eating
a piece of cake at the time

49
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:18,690
and you said, "Dude,
my semester is gonna be this."

50
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,952
Yeah, well,
it was supposed to be,

51
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:22,750
but my professor's like the
toughest grader I've ever seen.

52
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,660
She had like a bad
divorce this summer

53
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,600
and now she's taking
it out on us.

54
00:02:26,617 --> 00:02:28,871
To tell you the truth,
I think she just needs to get laid.

55
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:30,020
Really?

56
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:31,570
Laid, you say?

57
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:34,460
You wouldn't be into her.
She's, like, in her late 40s.

58
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:35,831
She hot?

59
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:37,701
Yeah, I guess she's
kind of hot, yeah.

60
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:39,173
And she's looking
for some action.

61
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:42,520
Sounds to me like she
could be a cougar.

62
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,300
- A what?
- A cougar.

63
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:46,872
An older woman,
usually in her 40s or 50s,

64
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:50,173
single and on the prowl
for a younger man.

65
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:53,412
What's a woman in her 60s or 70s--
a turtle?

66
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:56,890
Marshall, I've thought it over
and I accept your challenge.

67
00:02:56,905 --> 00:03:00,830
- I didn't challenge you to have sex...
- Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.

68
00:03:01,686 --> 00:03:03,903
So, I quit my job.

69
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:05,600
I just couldn't
take it anymore.

70
00:03:05,615 --> 00:03:09,292
Approximately 50 times a day,
some guy asks me for a lei...

71
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:10,851
Classic.

72
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:14,160
Ted, didn't you tell me they need
a new assistant in your office?

73
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:15,632
Yeah.

74
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:17,760
Somebody did just quit.

75
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:20,261
So, where should we eat today?

76
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:25,532
Oh awesome,
you brought lunch for everyone?

77
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:33,882
Dude, that is cold-blooded.

78
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:35,650
It was an honest mistake.

79
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,640
Look,  when somebody opens up a
container with an entire chicken in it,

80
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:41,272
it's okay to assume they
made lunch for everyone.

81
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:43,760
Ted, that girl didn't quit.
You destroyed her.

82
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:46,461
It was an whole chicken.

83
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,041
And did I mention
she had 12 sides?

84
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:51,263
Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure.
Real classy, Ted.

85
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:53,753
So, Lily, what do you say?
Do you want the job?

86
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:55,262
What would I be doing?

87
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,860
Basically, you're sort of
a general office assistant.

88
00:03:57,877 --> 00:04:00,783
You'll sit there.
My station is right over here.

89
00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:02,462
And things are a little
bit crazy right now

90
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:04,562
'cause we're pitching a new
building to a big client.

91
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:06,771
- Oh, right, is that the...
- Yeah.

92
00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:08,420
Here's the model.

93
00:04:10,445 --> 00:04:14,440
You weren't kidding.
It really does look like a giant penis.

94
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:15,513
I know.

95
00:04:15,528 --> 00:04:18,133
For whatever reason, Mr.
Druthers just doesn't see it.

96
00:04:18,145 --> 00:04:19,631
How can he not see it?

97
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:21,062
- I mean there's the...
- I know.

98
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:22,603
- And the way it...
- I know.

99
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:25,051
- And the two little...
- I know.

100
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:28,220
- Wow, it is just...
- Spectacular?

101
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:29,623
Why, thank you.

102
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:32,140
Lily, this is Mr. Druthers,
the head architect on the project.

103
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:34,063
Lily's going to be our
new office assistant.

104
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:36,060
- Ah.
- Nice to meet you.

105
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,551
Isn't it?

106
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:40,461
Ted, I looked at your design
for the penthouse balcony.

107
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:43,810
Tell me,
do you want to be an architect?

108
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:46,752
I, uh... I am an architect.

109
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:47,993
Really?

110
00:04:48,008 --> 00:04:50,923
Well, my six-year-old
nephew plays with Legos.

111
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:53,181
Is he an architect?

112
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:57,483
Well, not unless he somehow
passed all his licensing exams.

113
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,690
Ted, you've got promise.

114
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:02,162
But you have to study
what I do more carefully.

115
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,850
Now I want you to design
some Styrofoam trees

116
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:07,623
for the building model.

117
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:09,713
- Think you can handle that?
- Absolutely.

118
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,702
Good. So you're going
to design the...

119
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:16,750
- Styrofoam trees.
- Once again-- with feeling.

120
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:20,813
- Styrofoam trees.
- Styrofoam trees!

121
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:22,901
- Styrofoam trees!
- That's the spirit.

122
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:24,552
Now, gather 'round.

123
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:31,880
This isn't just about trees, Ted.
This is about life.

124
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:35,682
And sometimes in life,
you have to get the trees just right

125
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:37,580
or you're fired, hmm?

126
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:45,123
Man, that guy is
a total, well...

127
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:51,961
Okay,  wait, wait, wait.
That's Professor Lewis's office there.

128
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,260
Okay, let's take a look.

129
00:05:56,906 --> 00:06:00,791
Oh, yeah,
it's a cougar all right.

130
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:03,021
A prime specimen.

131
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:07,870
See,  you can identify a cougar
by a few key characteristics.

132
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:09,472
Start with the hair.

133
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:11,810
The cougar keeps up
with current hairstyles

134
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:14,020
as a form of camouflage.

135
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:16,910
The prey may not realize
that he's engaged a cougar

136
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:19,431
until he's already
being dragged, helpless,

137
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,021
back to her lair.

138
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:23,472
Now, the blouse.

139
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:26,441
The cougar displays
maximum cleavage possible

140
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,790
to captivate her prey.

141
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:31,002
If you're watching them bounce,

142
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,282
she's about to pounce.

143
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:35,330
See the claws?

144
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:37,951
Long and sharp,

145
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,383
to ward off rival females...

146
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,842
or open alimony checks.

147
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:47,280
Yeah, this one's a beaut.

148
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:53,643
Okay, let the hunt begin.

149
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:55,821
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm not so sure I'm comfortable

150
00:06:55,837 --> 00:06:58,840
with you hunting my
constitutional law professor.

151
00:06:58,857 --> 00:07:01,720
Who do you rather have
grading your papers--

152
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:05,560
a savage,
man-eating jungle cat,

153
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:09,461
or a purring, satisfied kitty?

154
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:13,470
Go, Barney.

155
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:16,613
Go mount and stuff that cougar.

156
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:24,133
Scusi, I am Luigi,
Italian exchange student.

157
00:07:24,146 --> 00:07:27,860
I was, uh, walking to class,

158
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:30,781
but then I noticed you...

159
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:33,080
bella principessa...

160
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:35,503
Tell me what you
want or get out.

161
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:36,893
Direct.

162
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,532
I like that.

163
00:07:38,548 --> 00:07:40,142
The name's Barney.

164
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:43,540
What I want... is you.

165
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:48,002
Turn around.

166
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:52,513
My place. Two hours.

167
00:07:53,297 --> 00:07:54,842
Don't be tardy.

168
00:07:57,087 --> 00:08:00,162
I can't believe how Mr.
Druthers treats people.

169
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:03,532
And that building?
Talk about overcompensating.

170
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:04,962
He's not usually this bad.

171
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:06,510
It's just that the partners
have made it very clear

172
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:08,392
this project is make
or break for us,

173
00:08:08,408 --> 00:08:10,702
so lately he's been
a little testy.

174
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:14,110
You know what I
mean-- crotchety.

175
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,742
I'm just saying it's
been hard on him.

176
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,531
All right stop.

177
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:22,381
- Did you show Lily your design?
- No.

178
00:08:22,397 --> 00:08:23,970
- What design?
- It's nothing.

179
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:25,353
It's fantastic.

180
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,760
Just for fun,
Ted's been working on his own design.

181
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:30,300
And it doesn't look at
all like male genitalia.

182
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:33,051
At least,
not healthy male genitalia.

183
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,480
Ted, you should pitch your
building to Druthers.

184
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:37,832
Are you kidding?
He's Hammond Druthers.

185
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:40,381
He's a legend.
I'm just part of his team.

186
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:41,740
This building is
huge for the firm,

187
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:44,071
so it's really important
we don't blow it.

188
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:46,452
All right, enough.

189
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:51,323
Oh, my God. Incredible.

190
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:54,280
Hmm... C-minus.

191
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:58,100
C-minus? What are
you talking about?

192
00:08:58,118 --> 00:09:00,610
I just pulled an all-nighter!

193
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:03,020
You didn't budget
your time well,

194
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:05,961
you glossed over some of
the most important points,

195
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:09,273
and your oral presentation
was sloppy and inconclusive.

196
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:14,321
Mr. Druthers asked if
you were making the trees

197
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:17,003
or waiting for them to
sprout on their own.

198
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:20,693
Then he stared at
me until I laughed.

199
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:22,881
Okay, I'm done.

200
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,192
Great. I'll put the paints away.
You just go show him.

201
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,810
Great. Thanks.

202
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:30,342
Well, finally.

203
00:09:30,356 --> 00:09:32,983
I wondered whether you
were making the trees

204
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:36,062
or waiting for them to
sprout on their own.

205
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:40,501
Good one, sir.

206
00:09:40,678 --> 00:09:42,711
Anyway, here they are.

207
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:47,491
- Too green.
- Too green?

208
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:50,471
Yes,  the leaves should really be
more of a natural brown color.

209
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:51,832
Almost brunette.

210
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:56,041
And think bushier.
I want this tower to rise

211
00:09:56,056 --> 00:10:00,190
from a thicket of wild,
ungroomed, brunette shrubbery.

212
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:02,241
Can you picture it, Ted?

213
00:10:02,257 --> 00:10:04,542
I can't un-picture it.

214
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:06,291
Good.

215
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:09,131
Oh, my God.

216
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:10,232
It's gone!

217
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:11,923
What? What's gone?

218
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:15,731
My baseball signed three
times by Pete Rose.

219
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:18,322
Well, it's got to be
around here somewhere.

220
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:19,612
What do you think, Ted,

221
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:23,382
it just let itself out of its
plastic case and rolled away?

222
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:25,371
Somebody stole it.

223
00:10:25,387 --> 00:10:28,493
Well, um, I better get back
to these Styrofoam trees.

224
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:30,570
Oh, who cares about the trees?

225
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:34,091
It's just busy work to make you
feel like you're contributing.

226
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,411
Inspiring as always, sir.

227
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:39,290
Lily?

228
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:43,892
Where's she put those paints?

229
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,650
Hey.

230
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:03,352
Hey. Um, Lily,
question for you.

231
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,333
Why did I find 
Mr. Druthers' baseball

232
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:08,231
signed three times by Pete
Rose in your desk drawer?

233
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:10,150
That's easy. I took it.

234
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,152
Why?

235
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,873
It's simple.

236
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:16,473
I can't believe there's no
horseradish for the roast beef.

237
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:20,780
I guess you were sick the day they
taught that at Sandwich University.

238
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:28,481
Mother, no one from the nursing
home is stealing from you.

239
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:31,442
I didn't get you a
birthday present.

240
00:11:37,786 --> 00:11:40,360
What? You gonna cry?

241
00:11:40,828 --> 00:11:43,053
Little crybaby's going to cry?

242
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,570
Hey, everybody, look!

243
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:47,892
The little crybaby's gonna cry!

244
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:52,533
I lost my ice cream!

245
00:11:53,218 --> 00:11:56,051
Okay, I may have
exaggerated that last one,

246
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:58,853
but the point is, he was mean.

247
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:01,193
And that's why I
took away his ball.

248
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:03,502
What does his ball have
to do with anything?

249
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,463
Druthers has to be taught
he can't behave like that.

250
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:09,371
When I was teaching kindergarten,
whenever a kid was mean,

251
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:11,422
I would take away
one of his toys.

252
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:13,320
The kid would be
upset at first,

253
00:12:13,336 --> 00:12:16,023
but then he'd learn
to stop being mean.

254
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:17,641
Hey, guys. What's going on?

255
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:20,663
Lily stole my boss' baseball
signed three times by Pete Rose.

256
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:22,391
Why? Was he being mean?

257
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:23,962
- You know about this?
- Yeah.

258
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:26,272
It's her own personal
form of justice.

259
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:28,051
Did you tell him about
that time at the Gap?

260
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:29,270
Oh, that was a good one.

261
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:31,231
This sales guy
was rude to Robin,

262
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:32,800
so I took a pair of khakis.

263
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:34,823
I gave them to you
for your birthday.

264
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,011
So I've been walking
around in stolen khakis?

265
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:39,791
I prefer to call them
"justice khakis."

266
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:42,511
That's not justice.
It's shoplifting, and it's a crime.

267
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:44,351
So is being mean.

268
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:46,522
Lily, your little system
doesn't even make sense.

269
00:12:46,537 --> 00:12:48,710
In kindergarten,
the kid knew why he was being punished.

270
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:50,910
Druthers just thinks
someone stole his ball.

271
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:52,740
Well, that's why I left a note.

272
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:54,241
- A note?
- Yeah.

273
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:57,130
When  he finds it, he'll understand
why his ball was taken away,

274
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:58,680
he'll stop being mean,

275
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:01,220
and the office will be
a nicer place to work.

276
00:13:01,237 --> 00:13:04,173
Maybe he'll even be open
to hearing your ideas.

277
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:06,262
Look, Lil, we're all tolerating

278
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:09,062
this prolonged nervous
breakdown you're clearly having,

279
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:12,160
with the punk band and the
beekeeping and the petty larceny,

280
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:14,613
but this is my career
you're messing with.

281
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:16,933
I'm not sure I like your tone.

282
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:18,511
You know what?

283
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:20,671
Now you just lost the ball.

284
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,290
Hey.

285
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:28,442
I'd ask you how last night went,
but we had a pop quiz today.

286
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,391
Nobody got higher
than a C-minus.

287
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:32,210
I know, I know.

288
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:33,731
You claim to have so much sex.

289
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,882
I only assumed
you'd be good at it.

290
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:38,231
Look, I miscalculated.

291
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:42,003
I thought she'd be old and fragile,
like most cougars.

292
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:44,191
But kitty's got claws.

293
00:13:44,385 --> 00:13:45,953
Don't worry though.

294
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,322
Tonight, I'm seeing her again.

295
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:49,631
Just let it go, man.
You're making things worse.

296
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:53,193
I promise you, after tonight,
that cougar will be my pet,

297
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,911
and I its master.

298
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:59,402
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

299
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:03,150
Oh, God.
That wasn't your first time, was it?

300
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:06,761
Although that would
explain a lot.

301
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:10,232
What? No. We had sex yesterday.

302
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:12,982
Oh, right. That.

303
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:16,363
Well, you had sex yesterday.

304
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:19,273
I revised my syllabus
for the spring semester.

305
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:24,242
When Druthers goes
to get his bagel,

306
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:26,671
I'll go in, grab the note,
put the ball back.

307
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:28,301
If something goes wrong,

308
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:30,823
yell out, "Who wants espresso?"

309
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,880
so I'll know he's coming.
Got it?

310
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:34,292
Okay, now give me the ball.

311
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,421
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

312
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:38,841
I mean I stand by
what I did, Ted.

313
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:41,070
Come on, Lily.
We're running out of time.

314
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:44,012
Everybody get in here now!

315
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,743
Who wants espresso?

316
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:54,001
Now, as most of you know,

317
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:57,740
my Pete Rose, Pete Rose,
Pete Rose baseball has been stolen.

318
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:59,291
Well, I just found this note.

319
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:03,931
"Dear Mr.
Druthers, I, your baseball, am leaving.

320
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,252
Maybe, if you start being nice,
I'll come back.

321
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:09,520
If not, other things in your
office may follow my lead.

322
00:15:09,538 --> 00:15:12,401
In fact,
I overheard your iPod talking,

323
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,791
and he may shuffle
off at any minute."

324
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,123
Normally, I would scream at
everyone until my voice goes,

325
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:23,741
but maybe that's the
wrong reaction here.

326
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:25,121
Interesting.

327
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:28,860
Instead, I'm giving my baseball
until the end of the day

328
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:31,363
to decide he's homesick,

329
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:34,603
or, tomorrow morning,
I'll begin firing three people an hour.

330
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:38,572
And, if the thief
doesn't believe me, well,

331
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:41,691
then you are gambling
more than Pete Rose--

332
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:43,590
major league baseball's
all-time hit leader,

333
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:46,170
a man whose absence from the
Hall of Fame is a travesty

334
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:50,930
to the entire sports world--
ever "allegedly" did!

335
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:55,592
Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.

336
00:15:57,335 --> 00:16:00,311
Give him his ball
back right now.

337
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:01,762
People are going to get fired.

338
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:04,713
No, they're not.
It's just a tantrum, Ted.

339
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:06,891
I saw this in kindergarten
all the time.

340
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:08,381
This isn't kindergarten.

341
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:11,782
Mr. Druthers is an adult,
and he wants his ball back.

342
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:15,072
All right, I'll give it back
if you show him your plans.

343
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:17,252
No. You'll give it
back or you're fired.

344
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:18,793
I'm sorry, Ted.
I just can't do that.

345
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:21,011
Then you're fired.

346
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,453
Fine.

347
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:26,610
Here's the ball.

348
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,653
At least you have one now.

349
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:35,060
Dude, you're killing me.

350
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,722
You didn't tame the cougar.
You just made her angrier.

351
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:42,380
Do you not see the
PowerBar in my hand?

352
00:16:42,396 --> 00:16:44,272
I'm fueling up.

353
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:46,241
So you're going
back over there?

354
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:47,370
Oh, yeah.

355
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:50,122
And tonight,
just like John Mellencamp,

356
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:53,860
I am going to get rid of the
"Cougar" once and for all.

357
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:55,610
Get it?

358
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,061
'Cause that's what he
did with his name.

359
00:17:08,845 --> 00:17:10,663
I can't stop
thinking about you.

360
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:12,630
Please give me another chance.

361
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,060
Barney, I teach all day.

362
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:16,743
It's the last thing I want
to do when I get home.

363
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:19,911
But you don't understand.
See, I've been going easy on you,

364
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:23,111
holding back, 'cause I was afraid
you'd break a hip or something.

365
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,363
But, this time, no mercy.
I don't care how long it takes--

366
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:29,461
days, weeks, half a year.

367
00:17:30,478 --> 00:17:32,621
Fine. Come in.

368
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:35,692
You can start while I
finish grading some papers.

369
00:17:37,827 --> 00:17:40,610
Hurry up.
Clients will be here any moment.

370
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:43,180
Now, slide it closer
to his chair.

371
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,793
I want this thing to really
smack him in the face.

372
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:50,283
Mr. Druthers, thank you again
for understanding about Lily.

373
00:17:50,298 --> 00:17:52,590
Oh. Well, I pity her.

374
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:56,482
I mean, to steal from my office and
then write that slanderous note...

375
00:17:56,496 --> 00:18:00,451
You might say that Lily
was mentally deranged.

376
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:03,060
You might say that, Ted.

377
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:07,663
Lily was mentally deranged.

378
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:11,933
You might even say it loud
enough for everyone to hear.

379
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:15,120
Lily was mentally deranged!

380
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:19,480
Oh! That's a bit harsh,
don't you think, Ted?

381
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:21,732
The clients are here.

382
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:23,443
Excellent. Bring them in.

383
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:27,820
Our client was a major bank and
financial services company in Spokane.

384
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:30,173
They wanted a modern
skyscraper that still captured

385
00:18:30,187 --> 00:18:33,123
the distinct flavor and
history of the Northwest.

386
00:18:33,135 --> 00:18:35,953
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you

387
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:39,681
the Spokane National
Bank Building.

388
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:44,671
That's a penis!

389
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:48,880
That's... that's ridiculous.

390
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:51,902
There's no way this majestic
tower can be confused

391
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:54,643
with the male organ of love.

392
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:56,853
We're  not building a penis.

393
00:18:57,017 --> 00:18:59,501
You got any other ideas?

394
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:02,141
Other ideas?

395
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:04,292
You said you wanted
Hammond Druthers.

396
00:19:04,306 --> 00:19:07,002
This is Hammond Druthers.

397
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:09,910
Well, hats off to
your ladyfriends,

398
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:12,263
but I'm not building it.

399
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,443
We're done here.

400
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:17,683
The trajectory of my entire
career might have been different

401
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:21,663
had I not unwittingly worn
my justice khakis that day.

402
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:23,233
Wait!

403
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:26,470
We have one more idea for you.

404
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:28,351
Ted, what are you doing?

405
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,813
I have another design.

406
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:32,123
Sit down, shut up right now.

407
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,493
No.

408
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,462
# Thank you for the invitation #

409
00:19:37,478 --> 00:19:40,172
# She showed me very nice... #

410
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:43,012
To Ted! The youngest person
to ever design a building

411
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:45,893
over 70 stories probably!

412
00:19:45,907 --> 00:19:48,351
Probably!

413
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:50,640
Congrats, Ted.

414
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,283
Hey, thanks for telling me
to stand up to Druthers

415
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:54,861
and pitch my idea.

416
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:57,590
Seriously, none of this would have
happened if it weren't for you.

417
00:19:57,605 --> 00:19:59,913
Oh. You know what, Ted?

418
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:01,413
That was very nice.

419
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:04,272
You have earned
these screws back.

420
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:07,660
Don't sit in your desk chair
until you've put them back in.

421
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,483
Hey, I'm project manager now,

422
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:12,703
so, if you want your
old job back...

423
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:14,233
No, thanks.

424
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:18,042
I think I figured out what
I want to be when I grow up.

425
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:24,250
Casey, that's not
how we treat people.

426
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,581
You'll get this back when
you learn to be nice.

427
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:41,853
- Barney! Oh, my God!
- What happened?

428
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:44,972
He broke his hip.

429
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:49,670
That's not true.
It's just temporarily dislocated.

430
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:50,862
Seriously, I'm fine.

431
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,041
No, he's not fine.

432
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:54,853
Professor Lewis, hi.

433
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:58,253
Mr. Eriksen. Hello.
I graded your paper tonight.

434
00:20:58,268 --> 00:21:01,453
I was pleasantly surprised.

435
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:03,561
Yeah, she was.

436
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,582
B-plus.

437
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:08,031
B-plus?!

438
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:11,690
Marshall, after I've gone through
my eight weeks of physical therapy,

439
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:14,220
I am going to get you that "A"!

440
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:16,093
Let her go.

441
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:19,753
She belongs out
there in the wild.

442
00:21:19,765 --> 00:21:21,621
You should feel proud.

443
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:25,043
You fought the
cougar and lived.

444
00:21:25,088 --> 00:21:27,801
It was an amazing safari.

445
00:21:27,815 --> 00:21:31,193
I can't wait to show
you guys the slides.
