1
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:12,258
- So, I guess that decides it.
- Yup.

2
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:13,704
Hanging out at a coffee place

3
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,447
is not nearly as much fun
as hanging out at a bar.

4
00:00:18,414 --> 00:00:19,872
Man, what's that?

5
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,382
What?

6
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:25,260
That cute coffee girl
wrote a heart by your name.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,825
Somebody has a crush on you.

8
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:30,804
Somebody thinks you're me.

9
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:33,451
Do you really
think she likes me?

10
00:00:33,588 --> 00:00:35,340
I mean, I guess 
it's not that surprising.

11
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:38,074
Every time I come in here,
I totally crack her up.

12
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:40,096
Marshall, here's
your pumpkin latte.

13
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:44,263
Wow. How did you fit a
pumpkin in this little cup?

14
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:47,561
I'll have a pumpkin latte.

15
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:50,023
How do they even fit a
pumpkin in those little cups?

16
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:51,993
What? You got a shrink
ray back there?

17
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:53,811
Yeah.

18
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:56,860
Hey, remember that
time I said that thing

19
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:59,732
about how do they fit a
pumpkin into that little cup?

20
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:01,532
- Which time?
- The first time.

21
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:04,491
Yeah. That was really funny.

22
00:01:04,645 --> 00:01:05,592
Right.

23
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:07,533
All right, there's only two
reasons she'd laugh at that.

24
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,971
One, it's the first
joke she's ever heard,

25
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,913
or two, she likes you.
You should totally ask her out.

26
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:13,522
You think?

27
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:15,033
Yeah, that why you're not
back with Lily, right?

28
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:17,512
So you can experience what
it's like to be single.

29
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:19,990
Well, what if the heart
doesn't mean anything?

30
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:22,000
What if she writes
it on all the cups?

31
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:24,063
Mine says "Ted," no heart.

32
00:01:24,077 --> 00:01:27,093
Mine says... "Swarley."

33
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,091
How'd they get
"Swarley" from "Barney"?

34
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:31,191
It's not even a name.

35
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,303
Who would ever be
called "Swarley"?

36
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:38,240
Oh, please don't start
calling me "Swarley."

37
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:42,661
This would never
happen at a bar!

38
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:46,730
Man! What's up with Swarley?

39
00:01:46,745 --> 00:01:49,632
I know. You almost never see
old Swarlz get that upset.

40
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:07,802
Hey, guess what?

41
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:08,740
Oh, sorry.

42
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:09,780
It's only my mom.

43
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,933
She's just rambling
on like always.

44
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:13,702
What happened?

45
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,081
Marshall asked out a girl.

46
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:16,103
Wow.

47
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:18,102
Well, if anything,
that's Dad's fault.

48
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:20,083
That'll keep her going a while.

49
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:22,543
Oh, of course, you know,
he had a little help.

50
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:23,633
Swarley hooked him up?

51
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:24,730
Oh, good. You got my text.

52
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:26,411
- Yeah.
- Oh. No, it was me.

53
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:28,342
I gave Marshall
one of my secrets.

54
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:31,142
- So, what she say?
- Nothing.

55
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:34,832
I don't think she heard me.
It's pretty busy up there.

56
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:36,633
What? You gave her
the look right?

57
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,572
Head down, eyes looking up,

58
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:40,712
hands in pockets, shoulders up,

59
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:43,640
head slightly tilted,
conveying shy vulnerability.

60
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:45,952
I think so.

61
00:02:51,915 --> 00:02:53,502
Look, can we just go?

62
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:56,210
Pumpkin latte for Marshall.

63
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,392
I didn't order that.

64
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:08,110
Phone number.

65
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:10,411
I love that look.

66
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:13,131
I think I slept with you
because of that look.

67
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:14,262
And it's fake?

68
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,791
Oh, and you biting your lower lip,
shyly looking away

69
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:19,330
and thrusting your
chest out is natural?

70
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:21,011
Yeah, I hear you.

71
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:23,723
- Hey!
- Hey, guys.

72
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:25,740
Are you free tomorrow night?

73
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:27,831
I was thinking of having
a wine tasting slash

74
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:30,292
"help me catch the rat
in my apartment" party.

75
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:32,993
That's a great idea.
You can put out cheese for both.

76
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:35,881
I  should invite
Marshall, right?

77
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:37,220
It'd be weird if I didn't.

78
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:39,292
Yeah, I don't think he can go.

79
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:40,901
Really? Why not?

80
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:43,241
Uh, okay, um...

81
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:45,483
Lily, we have to
tell you something.

82
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:47,361
Marshall has a date.

83
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:50,783
Oh. Well... good for him.

84
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,142
Really? You're okay with it?

85
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,093
Look, we've been broken
up almost six months.

86
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:56,332
I mean,
I'm not thrilled about the idea,

87
00:03:56,347 --> 00:03:59,493
but he has every right
to date someone else.

88
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,453
That's very mature.

89
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:03,121
Why are you holding the phone?

90
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:04,840
Oh, shoot.

91
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:08,690
That's hilarious, Mom.

92
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,831
Didn't even notice.

93
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:15,020
Hey, dude, by the way,
I really like that suit.

94
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:17,221
Tell me about the fabric.
Is it foreign or something?

95
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:20,162
Wow. It is foreign.
I'm impressed, Ted.

96
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:21,623
- It's Moroccan, actually.
- Whoa.

97
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,133
I got a call for Swarley.

98
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:26,281
Is there a Swarley here?

99
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:28,340
You weren't interested in
my suit at all, were you?

100
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,512
- Hmm?
- Swarley!

101
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:34,843
Yeah, I know he's there.
It's really important.

102
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,350
Could you ask again?

103
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:38,442
Important call for Swarley!

104
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:40,910
Geez, can't you hear him, Swarley?
There's a call for you.

105
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:43,410
Stop calling me that.

106
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:45,961
Uh... Hey, I'd like you guys
to officially meet Chloe.

107
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:46,961
- Hi.
- Hi.

108
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:47,860
Hi.

109
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:49,393
It's nice to meet you guys.

110
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:51,712
- I'll be right back.
- It's right back there.

111
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:58,383
Right? Right? She's hot!

112
00:04:58,396 --> 00:04:59,863
And she likes me?

113
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:03,160
She likes Italian food.
I also like Italian food.

114
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,590
She likes Billy Joel.
I also like... music.

115
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:09,551
And I think we're
going to go out again.

116
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:12,133
- Dude, you gotta ditch her.
- Obviously.

117
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:13,523
Why?

118
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:14,833
She's got the crazy eyes.

119
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:16,791
Dude. The eyes.

120
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:18,493
They're crazy.

121
00:05:18,505 --> 00:05:20,501
What are you guys talking about,
the crazy eyes?

122
00:05:20,516 --> 00:05:24,582
It's a well-documented condition
of the pupils, or pupi.

123
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:25,863
No. Just pupils.

124
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:29,341
It's an indicator of
future mental instability.

125
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:32,101
She does not have
the crazy eyes.

126
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:33,820
You just can't see it
because you're afflicted

127
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:36,731
with "haven't been laid
in a while" blindness.

128
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:38,601
She was too far away
in the coffee place,

129
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:41,520
but when I saw her
up close just now...

130
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:43,523
Hey, I'd like you guys to
officially meet Chloe.

131
00:05:43,536 --> 00:05:44,621
- Hi.
- Hi.

132
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:45,582
Hi.

133
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,362
It's nice to meet you guys.

134
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,550
You  guys,
I'm not going to stop dating Chloe

135
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:57,040
just because you think
she has the crazy eyes.

136
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:59,101
You can keep going out with her,
but you're gonna regret it.

137
00:05:59,138 --> 00:06:01,562
One time,
I met a girl at this very bar.

138
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:04,651
I saw that she had
the crazy eyes...

139
00:06:06,557 --> 00:06:07,830
...but I ignored it.

140
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:10,183
And then, sure enough.

141
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:12,921
Barney, can I ask
you a question?

142
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:14,410
Anything.

143
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:17,430
Would you like to
have a threesome?

144
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:19,084
Of course.

145
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:21,856
Great. It'll be you,
me and Mr. Weasels.

146
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:25,703
So, did you do it?

147
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,212
No. It ended up
being just a twosome

148
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:30,581
with the third one
watching from a chair.

149
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,622
Which one were you?

150
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:35,203
I'd rather not say.

151
00:06:35,517 --> 00:06:38,062
Look, there was a time I didn't
believe in the crazy eyes either,

152
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,010
and then I met Jeanine.

153
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:42,771
She had serious crazy eyes.

154
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:46,663
I told myself I was 
just imagining it, but then...

155
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:48,443
So, should we go get a drink?

156
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:50,860
As long as it's in
your apartment.

157
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:53,180
Whoa, I'm sorry.

158
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:58,101
Watch! Where! You're! Going!

159
00:06:59,998 --> 00:07:02,192
So, where do you live?

160
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:05,831
You guys, Chloe is not 
gonna do any of that stuff.

161
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:07,643
She's a nice girl
from Nebraska.

162
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:08,851
She's not crazy.

163
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:11,022
She's... she's awesome.

164
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:13,243
But you can't avoid
the crazy eyes forever.

165
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:16,183
Sooner or later, the crazy 
comes bubbling to the surface.

166
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:16,982
Hello?

167
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:18,620
Marshall, it's Chloe.

168
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:21,233
Are you the one who's
called me like nine times?

169
00:07:21,246 --> 00:07:23,342
Yeah. Could you come get me?

170
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:25,801
I'm in the middle
of taking a test.

171
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:27,773
Please. I'm so scared.

172
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:29,430
Well, what's going on?

173
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:31,463
This weird midget guy
started following me

174
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:32,651
and he was screaming at me

175
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:34,890
and he had a limp and
a big hump on his back

176
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:36,302
and the police
didn't believe me

177
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:39,152
and I almost got trampled
by a horse and...

178
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,042
God I must sound totally
crazy to you right now.

179
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:45,012
No. Pfft.

180
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:46,302
Not at all.

181
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:48,650
So, she's needy crazy.

182
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:50,442
That's one of the worst kinds.

183
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:51,760
I've had one of those.

184
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:53,462
Makes  up stories
to get attention.

185
00:07:53,477 --> 00:07:56,662
Went out with her for three weeks--
her dad died twice.

186
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:59,511
Guys, she was really
freaked out, okay?

187
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:01,080
Maybe the story is true.

188
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:03,832
What in the world would make
you believe that's a true story?

189
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:06,373
She's really hot.

190
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:08,693
They always are.

191
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,601
- You all done with that, Ted?
- Yeah.

192
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:14,310
Ned. I told you
to call him Ned.

193
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:16,322
That's just sad.

194
00:08:16,335 --> 00:08:18,103
Sorry, Swarley.

195
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:21,830
So, do just you
and Ted live here

196
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,611
or does Swarley live here, too?

197
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:26,553
Nah. Swarley has his own place.

198
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:30,942
What was that?

199
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,673
Oh, I, uh, dropped my keys.

200
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:36,560
So, here you go.

201
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:39,010
Two pumpkin beers.

202
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,881
I was joking.
They're regular beers.

203
00:08:44,735 --> 00:08:46,402
What is that?

204
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:55,193
This picture is broken.

205
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:58,100
Oh. That's too bad.

206
00:08:58,117 --> 00:08:59,923
Is that Lily?

207
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:02,223
Is that the girl you
were going to marry?

208
00:09:02,236 --> 00:09:04,391
Yeah. Is that what
that sound was?

209
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:06,632
Did you just smash this?

210
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:07,932
No.

211
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:10,222
Why would I do that?

212
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:13,561
Let me look into your eyes.

213
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:15,730
Okay.

214
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:21,301
I had a really
nice time tonight.

215
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:23,590
Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.

216
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:27,373
I  like your eyes a lot, too.

217
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,641
S top!

218
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,891
Hi. I'm Lily.

219
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:42,121
Stop!

220
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:44,221
Now, kids,
I know Lily hiding in the apartment

221
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:47,521
while Marshall was on a date with
another girl seems pretty crazy,

222
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:49,880
but when you hear her
side of the story,

223
00:09:49,898 --> 00:09:51,951
well, it's still pretty crazy.

224
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,182
What's up Swarlz?

225
00:09:54,196 --> 00:09:56,401
No. Okay? No. No more.

226
00:09:56,415 --> 00:09:58,470
I will not let this 
become a thing. It's over.

227
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,451
No more Swarley. No Swarlz.

228
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:02,940
No more Swar-lay.

229
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:05,923
No more Swar...
wait for it... ley.

230
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:08,512
No more Bob Swarley, mon.

231
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,473
No more. No! It's over.

232
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,062
Do you understand?

233
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:13,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

234
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,410
Thank you.

235
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,000
Nice.

236
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:21,192
- Why didn't you call me?
- Was I supposed to call you?

237
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:24,462
Yes, about the whole Marshall-
dating-another-girl thing.

238
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:25,592
You said you were fine with it.

239
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:28,621
Yeah, in front of Ted,
but then I shot you a look.

240
00:10:28,638 --> 00:10:30,973
- What look?
- This.

241
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:34,510
That doesn't seem like a look.

242
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:37,102
Yes it is. It means, 
"I'm upset call me later."

243
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:39,380
You should have pulled me aside
and told me what the look meant.

244
00:10:39,415 --> 00:10:41,263
If I pulled you aside,
I wouldn't need the look.

245
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:42,521
Well, maybe if it was a
more distinctive look...

246
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,390
Okay, the look isn't important.

247
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:47,472
What's important is that
I can't stand the idea

248
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:49,220
of Marshall dating
another woman.

249
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:51,700
I mean, what if 
he falls in love with her?

250
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:53,490
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

251
00:10:53,507 --> 00:10:56,051
Ted says she has
the crazy eyes.

252
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:56,783
What's that?

253
00:10:56,796 --> 00:10:59,170
Apparently, a thing women
have that guys can see

254
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:01,060
and it tells them that
the girl's crazy.

255
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:03,753
Oh, kind of like how you
never want to date a guy

256
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:05,123
with perfect fingernails?

257
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:07,001
Jerk nails. Exactly.

258
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:10,331
Well, did-did Ted say
whether she was good-looking?

259
00:11:10,346 --> 00:11:11,911
I mean,
'cause if I knew she was ugly,

260
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:14,021
then maybe I wouldn't
be so freaked out.

261
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:16,291
Uh, he didn't say,
but you can find out.

262
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:19,813
I think her name is Chloe--
she works at Cosa Coffee on 78th.

263
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:23,242
Phone call for Swarles Barkley?

264
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:26,803
Hey, Ted. No, he's not here.

265
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:29,032
Good one, though--
remember that one.

266
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:36,621
Is, um, Chloe here?

267
00:11:36,636 --> 00:11:38,853
She just left.
You can probably still catch her.

268
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:41,642
She's easy to spot--
she's got a pink umbrella.

269
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:43,300
Oh, thanks, Brian.

270
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:44,953
My name is Scott.

271
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:46,730
Your tag says Brian.

272
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,230
I know. Funny story.

273
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:49,661
So, I wake up this
morning, and...

274
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:51,671
Yeah, see you later, Brian.

275
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,701
There she is.

276
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:04,631
She doesn't look that great.

277
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:07,020
She's not fat,
but that doesn't mean anything.

278
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:09,530
I know tons of skinny,
ugly women.

279
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:12,182
That's right,
snotty girl in my yoga class,

280
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:14,442
I'm talking to you.

281
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:18,052
Come on, Chloe, turn around.

282
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:20,840
Here we go. Turn around, Chloe.

283
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:24,582
Come on,
show me that hideous face.

284
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:26,471
Damn it!

285
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:28,941
Ooh, I know,
I'll get ahead of her,

286
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,373
then I'll cut back so I... Aah!

287
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:34,083
Oh, my God, that hurts!

288
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:37,231
Turn around! Come on!

289
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:39,141
Just turn around!

290
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:41,530
Okay, this is ridiculous.

291
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:43,282
Hey!

292
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:48,523
Turn around!
What's the matter with you?

293
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,610
Hey, you!

294
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:53,961
Turn around!

295
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:58,160
Turn around, Chloe!

296
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:06,512
She's hot? I'm so sorry.

297
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:07,903
No, it's fine.

298
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,712
I-It just makes things easier.

299
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:11,391
Now that I know she's a threat,

300
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:14,461
all I have to do is keep Marshall
from ever seeing her again.

301
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:16,762
Okay, I have two plans--
you can help me choose.

302
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:17,933
Plan A--

303
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:20,753
remember that time Marshall
and I had sex in the bathroom?

304
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:22,732
Oops, I got knocked up.

305
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,870
- Lily.
- Okay, plan B

306
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,192
is called "Chloe's Accident."

307
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:28,681
- Just stop.
- What?

308
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:31,002
Lily, you can't do
any of those things.

309
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,772
If you two are ever
gonna get back together,

310
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:35,631
you have to let him work
out whatever this is.

311
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:38,002
I know. You're right.

312
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,201
Now, come on,
Ted asked us to be upstairs at 6:00.

313
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:42,230
Some surprise for Barney.

314
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:44,233
- Barney?
- Uh, Swarley.

315
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:47,861
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

316
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:49,232
Where's Marshall?

317
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:50,623
Oh, he's getting a haircut.

318
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:52,831
Oh. For his date.

319
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:54,392
Good for him.

320
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:56,270
Hope he has a good
time tonight.

321
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:58,152
Relax, you've got
nothing to worry about.

322
00:13:58,165 --> 00:13:59,603
The girl's crazy.

323
00:13:59,617 --> 00:14:01,151
Thanks!

324
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:03,592
He'll just have wild monkey
sex with her five times, max,

325
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:05,012
and be done with her.

326
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:06,600
Thanks again.

327
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:09,812
What are you doing?

328
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:13,022
I just wanted to listen to
a little music, that's all.

329
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:15,593
And this next one's
going out to Swarley.

330
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,492
All your friends know
you miss Barney,

331
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:20,053
but he's gone,
and you got to accept that, baby.

332
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:22,940
And, Swarley, you're gonna be 
a better woman for it.

333
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:26,033
Here's "I Am Woman"
by Helen Reddy.

334
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,831
Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman.
I love it!

335
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:32,631
You know, I was thinking about this
whole new name thing last night,

336
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:34,852
and you know what I realized?
I like it.

337
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:36,573
You like being called Swarley?

338
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:38,421
Are you kidding?
I want you to call me that.

339
00:14:38,438 --> 00:14:39,713
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

340
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:42,142
Do I think what's gonna work?
I'm just saying, I love my new name,

341
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:45,481
so please only call
me that from now on.

342
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,770
Call you what?

343
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:52,161
You know, that-that-that new name
that you've been calling me.

344
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:53,532
Say it.

345
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:55,391
Why? You guys know what it is.

346
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:57,083
Say the name.

347
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,613
No, I don't want to! I hate it!

348
00:15:00,628 --> 00:15:03,091
I hate it! It's not funny!

349
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:05,543
It's never been funny!
I've never done any...

350
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:07,083
No!

351
00:15:07,737 --> 00:15:09,831
Man, he is really gonna lose it

352
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:12,812
when all the magazine
subscriptions start coming in.

353
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,423
I signed him up for
People in Espanol,

354
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:18,220
but I addressed it to Swarlos.

355
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:21,860
Hey, where's the picture of
Marshall and me at the pier?

356
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,972
Didn't it used to
be by that window?

357
00:15:23,986 --> 00:15:27,480
Oh, yeah, he, uh,
he sort of took it down when you left.

358
00:15:27,496 --> 00:15:29,233
Put it behind some books,
I think.

359
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:31,562
Oh, well-well,
maybe I should put it back up.

360
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:33,623
Why, so Chloe'll see
it and get scared off?

361
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:34,733
No.

362
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:37,343
So Marshall'll see
it and feel guilty.

363
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:40,291
Yeah, okay.

364
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:42,472
But she wasn't okay.

365
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:45,201
Later that night,
while Marshall was on his date,

366
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:47,401
Lily came back.

367
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,942
...anymore.

368
00:16:05,956 --> 00:16:07,651
Pretty impressive, huh?

369
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:11,680
Wow, you really did memorize all the
lyrics to "We Didn't Start the Fire."

370
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:13,852
Can I, uh,
can I get you a drink?

371
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:15,282
I'd love a beer.

372
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:16,992
You got it.

373
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:22,190
Lily did what any
sensible woman would do.

374
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:24,541
She hid under the desk.

375
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:27,341
And she stayed there,
listening to her ex-fiance

376
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:29,561
on a date with another woman.

377
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:32,193
I had a really
nice time tonight.

378
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:34,240
Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.

379
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:36,942
I like your eyes a lot, too.

380
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:39,623
Finally, much like Billy Joel,

381
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:41,331
she couldn't take it anymore.

382
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:43,153
Stop!

383
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,093
Hi.  I'm Lily.

384
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:52,761
Lily... Lily,
what the hell are you doing?

385
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:56,093
I don't know. I...
I don't know... what I'm doing.

386
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:59,452
Oh, pumpkin beer--
that was a good one.

387
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,863
I'm just... I'm gonna go.
I... I'm so sorry.

388
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:05,903
En-Enjoy the rest of your date.

389
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:12,881
She seems nice.

390
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,393
- Lilly, what the hell...
- I'm sorry.

391
00:17:27,406 --> 00:17:29,543
I only snuck up
there because...

392
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:32,283
when I saw how cute she was yesterday,
I freaked out.

393
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:34,643
Lily, you saw her yesterday?

394
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:38,873
Yeah, I...
kind of chased her down the street.

395
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:45,232
Wait, so you were the
hunchback with the limp?

396
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:46,771
Yeah.

397
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:50,181
And she didn't break the picture,
I did.

398
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:55,623
So Chloe's not crazy, she's...

399
00:17:55,948 --> 00:17:59,291
just a nice, normal girl.

400
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:02,173
Yeah, she is.

401
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:06,380
And you deserve a nice,
normal girl.

402
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:09,572
So, why don't you
just go back up there

403
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:12,230
and-and finish your date.

404
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:15,790
Yeah.

405
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,250
Okay.

406
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:19,163
Okay.

407
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:25,063
Wait, if you were the hunchback,
then why did she think you were a guy?

408
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:30,793
I-I might have used a voice
that sounded like this.

409
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:32,870
- Why?
- Because I didn't want

410
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:36,070
her to know it was me, which 
I now realize doesn't make sense,

411
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:38,641
because she hadn't even met me.

412
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:40,971
You're crazy.

413
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:48,871
You have... crazier eyes than
anybody that I have ever met.

414
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:51,923
Shouldn't you be
going back up...

415
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:53,963
I mean,
you're out of your mind.

416
00:18:53,977 --> 00:18:58,203
You're... just
absolutely insane.

417
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:04,533
Shouldn't you be
going back upstairs?

418
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:10,653
I've missed you so much.

419
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:19,790
Okay, I ran it by the group,

420
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:21,221
and we decided we're
gonna give you a choice.

421
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:23,773
We will agree to stop
calling you Swarley,

422
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,291
but instead,
we'll call you Jennifer.

423
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:30,400
Well?

424
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:32,223
I'm thinking.

425
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:36,630
How about this?
On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays...

426
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:38,362
Hey.

427
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:39,990
Look at this.

428
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:41,933
So right there,
in the exact same place

429
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,112
that six months earlier I had
walked up and found Marshall alone,

430
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:48,860
crying over his breakup with Lily,
I found him again.

431
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:51,190
Only this time he wasn't alone,

432
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:53,031
and he was happy.

433
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:56,283
So we went to the bar to celebrate,
and it was great.

434
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,162
I was with Robin,
Marshall and Lily were back together,

435
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:01,103
and Barney had a cool new name.

436
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:03,471
All was right with the world...

437
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,610
until we got back
to the apartment.

438
00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:07,753
Oh, my God.

439
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:09,773
Hey, Chloe, I...

440
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:11,710
guess I forgot I
left you up here.

441
00:20:11,728 --> 00:20:15,411
I was gonna leave,
but I can't find my keys.

442
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:19,392
They're right there
on the coffee table.

443
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:22,810
Silly me.

444
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:25,801
I must have looked
everywhere else.

445
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,821
Well... I'm just gonna go.

446
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:34,873
Oh, I don't think we've met.
I'm Chloe.

447
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:35,882
Robin.

448
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:38,221
It's nice to meet you, Roland.

449
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:40,440
I'll see you guys later.

450
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:45,090
Roland?

451
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:48,101
Your name's Roland.

452
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:51,103
That's funny, right?

453
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,380
Rock and Roland.

454
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:57,112
Warsaw is the capital
of what? Roland.

455
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,402
You're Monica Roland-ski.

456
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:06,123
Hey, yeah,
that's just how I Roland.

457
00:21:06,428 --> 00:21:08,390
- Nice try, Swarley.
- Damn it.

458
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:19,741
Swarley!

459
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:22,061
# Sometimes you want to go #

460
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:26,820
# Where everybody #
# knows your name #

461
00:21:27,138 --> 00:21:30,011
# And they're always #
# glad you came... #
