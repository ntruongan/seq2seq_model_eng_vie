1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:04,623
It was taken back in 2006, when
Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me

2
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:06,123
and we all went out to brunch.

3
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:07,994
We all look pretty
happy, right?

4
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:09,299
Wrong.

5
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,663
I wish your face
would melt off.

6
00:00:10,673 --> 00:00:11,943
I wish your eyeballs
would explode.

7
00:00:11,973 --> 00:00:14,417
- I hate you.
- I hate you more.

8
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:16,621
- I'm going to kill him.
- I can't say I blame you.

9
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:18,921
No, I mean I'm seriously
going to kill him.

10
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:21,343
I don't care how unpleasant it is.
You have to talk to him.

11
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:23,264
- Not now.
- Okay, if you don't, I will.

12
00:00:23,276 --> 00:00:24,480
Robin...

13
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:27,845
Okay, for any of this to make sense,
you got to understand,

14
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:29,713
there are three
parts to this story.

15
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,150
Let's start with the
Marshall and Lily part.

16
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:38,272
As a 30th anniversary gift, I had flown
my parents to New York for the weekend.

17
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:40,370
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
your cousin Jimmy

18
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:42,941
had a wonderful time at
that spa he visited.

19
00:00:42,956 --> 00:00:46,191
You mean the spa the judge ordered
him to go to to quit cocaine?

20
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:47,710
Coffee?

21
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,801
Now, Grandma and Grandpa didn't
like to talk about things

22
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:52,861
that were
uncomfortable, emotional,

23
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,870
or in any way... real.

24
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:56,782
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.

25
00:00:56,796 --> 00:00:58,791
Oh, Lily! Hi, Marshall.

26
00:00:58,808 --> 00:00:59,732
Good to see you.

27
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:02,441
I was just stopping by to
pick up some of my things.

28
00:01:02,456 --> 00:01:05,750
Yes, we were so sorry
to hear about your...

29
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:07,992
you know, the, the...

30
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:11,250
Well...

31
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:13,301
Lily calling off the
wedding and dumping me?

32
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:16,333
Me begging Marshall to take
me back and him rejecting me?

33
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:18,193
I love your hair.

34
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:34,680
This was only the second
time Marshall and Lily

35
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:36,590
had seen each other
since breaking up,

36
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:38,950
but to their credit,
it wasn't that awkward.

37
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,422
Actually, we're cool.

38
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:43,491
We just divided up CDs.
It was all very civil.

39
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:45,202
I'm proud of us;
we're, we're good.

40
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,680
Well, we were all going to
go to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00.

41
00:01:48,698 --> 00:01:50,950
Lily, would you
like to join us?

42
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:52,781
Um...

43
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:54,042
What?

44
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:58,360
Well, I-I don't want to go if it
would make you uncomfortable.

45
00:01:58,378 --> 00:01:59,762
Why would it?

46
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:02,662
Well, I mean, yeah, we're...
we're good,

47
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:07,032
but you got to admit there's
that stuff between us.

48
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:08,873
Um, not for me.

49
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:11,123
Now it's just like
we're friends.

50
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:14,170
It's like we're
brother and sister.

51
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:17,961
"Brother and sister"?!

52
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:22,491
Okay. Fine, yeah,
I'll see you at the restaurant, bro.

53
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,700
See? Not awkward at all.

54
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:29,623
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi.

55
00:02:29,638 --> 00:02:31,140
Hello, Marshall.

56
00:02:31,157 --> 00:02:33,401
Lily, that is a stunning dress.

57
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:35,331
Oh, thanks.

58
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:37,461
It's kind of revealing,
but I thought,

59
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:40,820
"Hey, we're all
family." Right, bro?

60
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:43,321
What's wrong?

61
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:46,662
Oh, I,
I hurt my ankle in yoga today.

62
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:49,110
The instructor told me to
just take deep breaths

63
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,410
to get through
the pain, just...

64
00:02:58,116 --> 00:03:01,503
Are you all right?
You're kind of sweating.

65
00:03:01,518 --> 00:03:03,653
No, I'm fine. It's just...

66
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:06,552
this roll is really spicy.

67
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:08,780
Lily is evil!

68
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:10,961
She just wore that
dress to torture me.

69
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,040
Well, you know what?
Two can play at that game.

70
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:16,202
See, at brunch,
I'm going to torture Lily right back.

71
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:19,380
Yeah. There's a part of my body
that she's got a weakness for, too.

72
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:22,122
Dude, you can't whip
that out at brunch.

73
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:24,400
No, not that.

74
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:28,473
I'm going to unleash my calves.

75
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:30,692
That's crazy.

76
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:32,791
Nobody's turned on
by men's calves.

77
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:35,301
They're a thoroughly
unerotic body part.

78
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:39,372
Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I
had those skinny little chicken legs.

79
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:43,761
I'll be waiting by the
phone for your apology.

80
00:03:45,155 --> 00:03:47,703
So Marshall showed up
at brunch with a plan.

81
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:49,143
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

82
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:50,522
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hey.

83
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:52,283
Hey. How are you feeling?

84
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:54,551
You looked kind of
feverish last night.

85
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,701
Oh, no, I actually feel great.

86
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:00,061
It is kind of warm in here,
though, isn't it?

87
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:02,650
Oh, I don't know,
if anything, it's kind of...

88
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,641
What are you doing?

89
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:05,493
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

90
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:09,440
I'm just making myself feel a
little bit more... comfortable.

91
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:15,442
Oh.

92
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:17,891
Oh, yes.

93
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:21,490
I've been doing all these
toe lifts lately, and so...

94
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:24,752
my calves have really
been cramping up.

95
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:35,530
Take off your dress.

96
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:37,862
Take  off the rest
of your pants.

97
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:41,410
I really wasn't
expecting that to happen.

98
00:04:41,426 --> 00:04:43,490
Yeah, me neither. It kind of
complicates things, doesn't it?

99
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:47,640
Yeah, it does. Why did you have to
throw your magnificent calves at me?

100
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,213
You know you have
a punter's leg.

101
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:51,652
Well, why did you have to throw
your beautiful boobs at me?

102
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:54,250
You know you have... boobs.

103
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:57,953
Just admit it,
you came here trying to seduce me.

104
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,921
Seduce you? You seduced me.

105
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:02,870
You sat down next to me and
took most of your pants off.

106
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,133
You went to San Francisco
for three months.

107
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:06,571
How is that seducing you?

108
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:08,131
Well, it's not but I'm
still mad about it.

109
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:10,621
All right, that's it--
I want The Beatles Anthology.

110
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:11,962
Oh, well, that's too bad;
I'm keeping it.

111
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:14,040
And you know the U2
box set I gave you?

112
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:16,102
Look inside--
all Dave Matthews.

113
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:17,511
You are evil.

114
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,201
S mile.

115
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:22,352
I'm going to kill him.

116
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:23,673
I can't say I blame you.

117
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:26,692
No, I mean I'm seriously
going to kill him.

118
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,940
Now let's talk about the
Barney part of the story.

119
00:05:32,117 --> 00:05:34,841
This was going to be Robin's
first time meeting my parents,

120
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:37,163
so we were both
a little nervous.

121
00:05:38,106 --> 00:05:40,060
Barney, what are
you doing here?

122
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:42,070
Uh... I'm here to
meet your parents.

123
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:43,351
They must be dying
to meet me after all

124
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:45,302
the legendary Barney
stories you've told them.

125
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:47,213
I haven't told them any
legendary Barney stories.

126
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,130
What?

127
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:53,040
Barney, here is a list of all the things
I talk with my dad about: baseball.

128
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:56,701
But I'm your best friend.

129
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:57,792
Well, actually Marshall's my...

130
00:05:57,826 --> 00:05:59,622
I'm the most important
person in your life.

131
00:05:59,638 --> 00:06:00,682
Well, Robin's actually...

132
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:03,051
How could your parents
not know about me?

133
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:04,411
I'm delightful.

134
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:08,662
To us, sure, in very small,
infrequent doses.

135
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:10,502
I mean, come on,
you're not exactly the kind of friend

136
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,303
parents want their kid to have.

137
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:13,861
Oh, really?

138
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,112
Then I guess those
shoes aren't the thing

139
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:18,452
you're most wrong about today.

140
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,930
-  Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.
- Ted.

141
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:25,643
I know you've all been
excited to meet...

142
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:29,663
Barney Stinson.
An honor to meet the two of you.

143
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:32,093
That needlepoint "Bless This
Mess" pillow you made for Ted--

144
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,434
what a stitch.

145
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:35,600
Stitch! Did that just happen?

146
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:39,385
Uh, Mom, Dad,
this is my girlfriend, Robin.

147
00:06:39,397 --> 00:06:40,411
- Hello.
- Hello.

148
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:42,370
Oh, it's wonderful
to meet you, Robin.

149
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:45,392
Oh, you are so pretty.
Isn't she pretty, Al?

150
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,471
A real looker.

151
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:49,793
That's funny, I didn't even
"look" in the mirror today.

152
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:54,212
That's not anything, is it?

153
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:58,920
So, I made a reservation at
San Marino tonight for 8:00.

154
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:01,162
San Marino.

155
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:02,863
Oh, you're serious? Yikes.

156
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,311
No. We have to
try Casa A Pezzi.

157
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,513
Best salmon risotto
I have ever had.

158
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,742
I love salmon risotto.

159
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:11,522
I know.

160
00:07:12,018 --> 00:07:14,250
How are we supposed to get
a table at Casa A Pezzi?

161
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:15,570
They're booked for weeks.

162
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:18,352
Well, lucky for you,
I happen to know the head waitress,

163
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:20,780
which is ironic because...

164
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:26,721
Ironic because we both work at a
homeless shelter where I serve the food.

165
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,152
Where do you volunteer, Robin?

166
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,791
What's the matter with you?

167
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:34,353
I'm his girlfriend,
and I'm not even trying that hard.

168
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,400
Way to wreck the
curve, kiss-ass.

169
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:38,260
Robin, I'm his best friend.

170
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:39,510
That's a commitment.

171
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,180
Girlfriend, that's
like a bad flu.

172
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,280
Out of your system after
a couple weeks in bed.

173
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,820
High five.

174
00:07:46,338 --> 00:07:47,580
Can I help?

175
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:49,191
Yes, you can, Virginia.

176
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:53,020
There's a story behind that broach,
and I'm going to hear it.

177
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:54,780
Well, funny you should ask.

178
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:01,471
Whoa! Bravo, Barney.

179
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,982
That is my all-time
favorite sonata.

180
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:06,721
Barney, you are
just delightful.

181
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:10,041
No, Virginia, you're delightful,
I am deligh-ted.

182
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:11,352
And he's just Ted.

183
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:14,522
I'm really not planning these things;
they just keep happening.

184
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:17,943
Whoops. I think I dropped
an ice cube down here.

185
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,651
Ow, it's so cold.

186
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:22,232
All right, that's it,
I'm out of here.

187
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:25,772
In a minute.

188
00:08:26,346 --> 00:08:28,323
Anyone up for a
drink at MacLaren's?

189
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:29,812
- No, I'm kind of tired.
- Me, too.

190
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,051
Yeah, I'm sure my
folks are gonna want...

191
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:33,981
I feel like I could knock
back a few cervezas.

192
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:35,863
Cervezas?

193
00:08:35,878 --> 00:08:37,600
Did he fall?

194
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:41,531
I'd join you, too, but I want to
get up early for Mass tomorrow.

195
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:45,150
St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m.,
it's my favorite service.

196
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:49,282
Wait a minute-- you're able to
cross the threshold of a church?

197
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,562
I'll save you a seat.

198
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:53,242
Oh, you are just terrific.

199
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:55,311
Isn't he, Susan?

200
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,951
Robin.

201
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:59,772
Susan, her name is Virginia.

202
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:05,330
Dude, I am sincerely ticked
at your dad right now.

203
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:06,600
Why?

204
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:09,341
Last night,
we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?

205
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:11,871
So Barney darts back
into the burning house,

206
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:14,003
lifts up the refrigerator
I'm pinned under

207
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:16,111
and pulls me to safety.

208
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:18,443
Whoa. You're like a hero.

209
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:20,632
Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy.

210
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:22,603
You know who is a hero?

211
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:25,261
My Dalmatian, Smokey.

212
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:29,892
He... didn't... make it out.

213
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:32,513
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,570
You poor, brave man.

215
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:38,851
Why don't you give
the guy a hug?

216
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,870
I'm... oh.

217
00:09:44,778 --> 00:09:47,362
My dad was your wingman?

218
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,931
This is really
messing with my head.

219
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:51,851
Barney, is my dad cool?

220
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:53,493
I'm not done.

221
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:55,993
So, your dad stays
to finish his drink,

222
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:59,130
but I take off because I have to be
up early for Mass with your mom.

223
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:00,453
Sure.

224
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:04,922
Anyway, I realize that I left my
phone on the bar, so I come back...

225
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,332
Oh, my God...

226
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:16,661
Oh, my God.

227
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:18,580
Is that really...

228
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:22,190
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

229
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:25,730
Can you believe your dad
rack-jacked me like that?

230
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:34,202
My dad made out with
Wendy the waitress?

231
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,811
He cheated on my mom?
No, that's impossible.

232
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:39,823
Ted, it's a well-known
statistic that 83% of people

233
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:42,701
married longer than six months
are seeing someone on the side.

234
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:46,511
Do you know that when you make up
a statistic, you always use "83%"?

235
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:48,223
You think I'm lying.

236
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:50,302
Well, have you done any
surveys on the subject?

237
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,263
Because the good people at
www.swingers.open-marriage-is natural\

238
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:57,912
legalize-polygamy.org have,
and they beg to differ.

239
00:10:57,926 --> 00:10:59,321
That's not a real Web site.

240
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:03,291
Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real
T-shirt for running in their 10K.

241
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:09,591
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Ted. Barney.

242
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:12,092
- Enjoying your vacation so far?
- Oh, yeah.

243
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,302
Uh, listen,
can I speak to you outside for a sec?

244
00:11:14,315 --> 00:11:15,662
Sure.

245
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:21,402
So you went out with
Barney last night?

246
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:22,561
Yeah.

247
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:23,970
You have a good time?

248
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:26,362
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sorry you couldn't join us.

249
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:29,860
Yeah.

250
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:31,962
So...

251
00:11:32,806 --> 00:11:34,093
What?

252
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:35,942
Well...

253
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:38,500
Well what?

254
00:11:40,256 --> 00:11:43,713
You think Cerrano's got
a shot at the RBI title?

255
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:46,960
I wanted to confront him,
but I couldn't.

256
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:50,200
I guess I got the let's-not-talk-
about-anything-uncomfortable gene

257
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:52,841
Well, you didn't get your dad's
close-the-deal gene, that's for sure.

258
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:54,331
Smile.

259
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:55,761
Great.

260
00:11:55,777 --> 00:11:59,222
I  don't care how unpleasant it is.
You have to talk to him.

261
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:00,440
Not now.

262
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,222
Okay, if you don't, I will.

263
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:03,543
Robin...!

264
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:07,091
Okay, now I got to back up
all the way to the beginning

265
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:10,003
to tell you the me and
Robin part of the story.

266
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:13,833
We were expecting my
parents at any minute.

267
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:15,492
One last thing about my mom.

268
00:12:15,505 --> 00:12:17,140
She grills every single
one of my girlfriends

269
00:12:17,177 --> 00:12:19,470
about when we're gonna
get married and have kids.

270
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:21,103
But this is the first
time she's meeting me.

271
00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:21,812
Doesn't matter.

272
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:24,302
And you'll know it's coming when
she mentions my cousin Stacy--

273
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:26,122
six kids in five years.

274
00:12:26,135 --> 00:12:28,992
The woman's basically
a ride at a water park.

275
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:32,371
But I don't want to get
married and have kids.

276
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:33,913
What am I supposed to say?

277
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:35,251
You know what?

278
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:37,922
You're an adult with
perfectly valid opinions.

279
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:39,422
You shouldn't have to
apologize for them.

280
00:12:39,455 --> 00:12:41,572
- I'm gonna lie.
- I would.

281
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:45,800
Thanks again for letting
me have the U2 box set.

282
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:48,110
I know how important
it is to you.

283
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:50,583
I talked to Aunt
Caroline the other day.

284
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:52,772
Stacy's pregnant again.

285
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:55,113
Oh,  good for her.

286
00:12:55,128 --> 00:12:57,192
- So, dear...
- Oh, boy.

287
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:58,912
Tell us what it's like
being a journalist.

288
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:00,650
I'm just not ready.

289
00:13:00,665 --> 00:13:03,073
Okay. No pressure.

290
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:06,330
Oh. Uh, I thought you, um...

291
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,821
It's great.

292
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:08,760
Good.

293
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:12,170
Focus on your job now,
because your career clock is ticking.

294
00:13:12,185 --> 00:13:16,142
There's time for marriage and kids
and all that other stuff later.

295
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:19,620
Ooh, a piano!

296
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:23,421
You lucked out with my
mom last night, huh?

297
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:24,523
What a relief, right?

298
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:25,733
Oh, absolutely.

299
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:27,862
Whew, what a relief it is to
know I'm the one girlfriend

300
00:13:27,895 --> 00:13:30,312
your mom doesn't want
you to have kids with.

301
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:32,202
Hooray?

302
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:35,360
I mean, did she really think that
your college girlfriend Cheryl

303
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:37,181
would pop out
attractive children?

304
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:39,303
'Cause I've seen pictures,
and, I'm sorry,

305
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:42,111
that girl had a brow
ridge like a caveman.

306
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,863
Come on, she was just
frowning under direct light.

307
00:13:44,877 --> 00:13:47,593
And besides, that's not even what
I liked about her. It was her...

308
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:49,492
It's not important.

309
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:53,192
What happened to
Marshall and Lily?

310
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,653
They've been fighting lately.

311
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,793
They're probably off
somewhere going at it.

312
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:58,011
More coffee?

313
00:13:58,028 --> 00:14:00,102
Oh, no, thank you.

314
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:03,101
Isn't she sweet?

315
00:14:03,117 --> 00:14:06,732
Well,  if she's so sweet,
maybe she should have Ted's babies.

316
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:08,581
Excuse me?

317
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:10,130
Nothing.

318
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:16,800
Just a minute.

319
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:18,582
Maybe less.

320
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:21,953
Robin, dear.
Did I say something to upset you?

321
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:24,462
Why don't you want me
to have your grandkids?

322
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:26,711
Do you want to
have my grandkids?

323
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:29,791
No! I mean, I don't know.

324
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:33,222
I just... I want you to want me
to want to have your grandkids.

325
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:35,990
And you should.
I'm a genetic gold mine.

326
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:38,731
No family history of
diabetes or heart disease.

327
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:42,071
Everyone has nonporous
teeth and perfect eyesight.

328
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:46,361
I had one schizophrenic uncle,
but even he had perfect vision.

329
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,312
Which was unfortunate

330
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:50,931
for the people around
the bell tower he was in,

331
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:53,111
but still he was a
very fine man, and...

332
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,091
Excuse me. Sorry.
Didn't know that there was a line.

333
00:14:56,157 --> 00:14:58,023
Marshall, your zipper.

334
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:08,972
Robin, it's not that I
don't want grandkids.

335
00:15:08,987 --> 00:15:11,141
It's just I don't think anyone
should make the mistake

336
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:13,151
of getting married too young.

337
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,193
Why do you say that?

338
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:17,762
I mean, you got married pretty young.
That wasn't a mistake.

339
00:15:18,837 --> 00:15:20,471
Was it?

340
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,971
Well...

341
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:24,121
Okay, there's something
you don't know.

342
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:25,823
Smile.

343
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:27,583
I wish your face
would melt off.

344
00:15:27,597 --> 00:15:29,160
I wish your eyeballs
would explode.

345
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:30,010
I'm gonna kill him.

346
00:15:30,028 --> 00:15:32,280
I don't care how unpleasant it is,
you have to talk to him.

347
00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:34,422
- Not now.
- Okay, if you don't, I will.

348
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:35,590
Robin...!

349
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:39,550
Oh, gosh, let me help you
pick those up, sweetheart.

350
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:41,741
Sweetheart? Sweetheart?!

351
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:43,422
The only sweetheart in your
life should be the woman

352
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:45,860
you married 30 years ago,
not the waitress at the bar last night

353
00:15:45,896 --> 00:15:48,243
and not this clumsy floozy!

354
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:49,740
I'm sorry, you're not a floozy.

355
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:52,103
I'm upset,
I don't know what I'm saying.

356
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,652
But stay away from my dad.

357
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:57,552
Ted, what are you
talking about?

358
00:15:57,586 --> 00:15:58,942
Dad?

359
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:03,533
You, uh, want to tell Mom what
happened at the bar last night?

360
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:07,053
Okay.

361
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,431
I hooked up with a waitress.

362
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:11,372
Oh.

363
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:13,542
Oh?

364
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,423
I mean, oh!

365
00:16:15,438 --> 00:16:17,702
Oh! Ooh!

366
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:20,961
We're going to have a serious talk
about this when we get home, Al.

367
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:23,012
Oh, ooh!

368
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:25,442
Serious talk? Mom, what...?

369
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:27,912
He was kissing another woman.
Don't you care?

370
00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:29,842
Mrs. Mosby?

371
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:34,903
Ted, we weren't quite sure
how to tell you this...

372
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:37,651
Your mother and I are divorced.

373
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:45,573
What do you mean you're divorced?
Since when?

374
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:48,163
Oh, gosh,
it's been about nine months now.

375
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:49,571
Closer to ten, I think.

376
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:51,463
Time flies.

377
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:54,090
So ten months ago,
you just up and decided

378
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:55,890
to get divorced
without telling me?

379
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:57,562
No, it wasn't a snap decision.

380
00:16:57,576 --> 00:17:00,082
We'd been separated
almost two years.

381
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:02,061
How could you not
tell me this?!

382
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:05,411
We meant to, it just never
seemed like the right time.

383
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,383
So last Christmas...?

384
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:09,280
We talked about
telling you kids then,

385
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:11,563
but it didn't seem
very Christmasy.

386
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:14,280
I got you a tandem bike.

387
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:17,582
Oh, it didn't go to waste. Your mother
and Frank ride it all the time.

388
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:19,030
Who the hell is Frank?!

389
00:17:19,048 --> 00:17:22,543
Oh, great guy.
I actually set them up.

390
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,893
You remember Dr. Muchnik.
He did your braces.

391
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,770
Okay, my head's
about to explode,

392
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:32,881
and I don't want to get it
all over everyone's waffles,

393
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:34,401
so I am leaving.

394
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,420
Teddy bear, oh...

395
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:43,421
You know,
he mentioned he was divorced last night.

396
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:45,201
I totally spaced on that.

397
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:49,162
Ooh, no line at
the omelet station.

398
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:56,890
Lily...

399
00:17:57,298 --> 00:18:00,030
I'm sorry that I said
all those things.

400
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:01,753
Me, too.

401
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:06,162
I just find it really confusing
to be around you right now.

402
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:07,882
It's the same for me.

403
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:10,952
I think we're probably
both better off trying

404
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,682
to keep some distance
for a while.

405
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:15,730
Yeah, I think you're right.

406
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:24,820
Are you wearing a push-up bra?

407
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,303
Did you Mystic Tan your calves?

408
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:28,240
I withdraw the question.

409
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,861
We're sorry we didn't say
anything about the divorce.

410
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,312
It was wrong not to tell you.

411
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:36,763
Thank you.

412
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:38,242
But listen,
don't tell your sister.

413
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:40,182
It would just upset her.

414
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:42,430
No, this is ridiculous!

415
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:45,791
We have to start talking about stuff,
and not just baseball.

416
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:47,810
Indians won today on
a walk-off double.

417
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:50,203
Against the Red Sox?
Boy, that's a big win.

418
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:53,143
No. No. No.
We're not gonna blow past this.

419
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:55,153
I mean,
I don't even know who you people.

420
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,343
I don't even know how you met.

421
00:18:57,357 --> 00:18:59,040
I never told you how
I met your mother?

422
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:00,882
- No.
- Oh, great story.

423
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:02,423
At a bar.

424
00:19:04,285 --> 00:19:05,650
That's it?

425
00:19:05,668 --> 00:19:08,651
That's what passes for
communication in our family?

426
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:11,371
Man, when I have kids,
and I tell them how I met their mother,

427
00:19:11,388 --> 00:19:14,523
I'm gonna tell them everything,
the whole damn story.

428
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:17,731
I think it was an Irish bar.

429
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:21,803
I just, I don't...
I don't understand.

430
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:23,522
You seemed so happy.

431
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,882
When I was growing up,
you seemed so...

432
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:27,553
What happened?

433
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:30,133
We just realized we're
very different people.

434
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:32,533
Your father's kind of a
head-in-the-clouds romantic,

435
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,970
and I'm much more
down to earth.

436
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:36,153
So?

437
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:38,901
Robin and I are like that.
That doesn't mean anything.

438
00:19:38,915 --> 00:19:41,710
I wanted kids.
And your mother...

439
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:44,591
also wanted kids.

440
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:47,520
Robin and I have different
views on families.

441
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:49,263
We're not about to
break up because of it.

442
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:52,222
On some level, I always knew.

443
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:54,482
I didn't even want to go out
with him in the beginning.

444
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:58,483
But he spent months badgering
me until I finally gave in.

445
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:03,653
Well, when you don't connect on
that many fundamental levels,

446
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:07,580
it's only a matter of time before you
realize you're not meant to be together.

447
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:10,870
But we love Robin.

448
00:20:10,885 --> 00:20:11,871
Absolutely.

449
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:14,002
Meeting you was the
highlight of my trip.

450
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:16,381
Well, second highlight.

451
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:20,170
- We'll see you inside.
- Sorry.

452
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:26,480
Wow.

453
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:28,090
I know.

454
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:31,503
They love me!

455
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:37,670
So we are definitely going
to try and communicate more.

456
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:39,451
From now on, full disclosure.

457
00:20:39,468 --> 00:20:43,233
Good. Good, I think it'll be
really good for the family.

458
00:20:43,248 --> 00:20:46,933
By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't
returned my last couple calls.

459
00:20:53,198 --> 00:20:55,761
I'm gonna get some juice.

460
00:20:57,665 --> 00:20:59,391
No.

461
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:03,343
No.

462
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:07,513
You missed a great game last night.
Real squeaker.
