1
00:00:01,814 --> 00:00:03,995
..learn about relationships
is that you're never done

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:05,382
getting to know someone.

3
00:00:05,392 --> 00:00:07,133
Everyone has secrets.

4
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:08,423
Some are nice.

5
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:10,581
You know how to make crepes?

6
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:13,072
That is so cool.

7
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:16,675
Some aren't as nice.

8
00:00:16,685 --> 00:00:19,060
And then there was Derek,
and counting you,

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,943
- that puts the total up to--
- Oh, I got your total.

10
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:23,830
I've been counting along.

11
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:27,631
And some are just weird.

12
00:00:27,647 --> 00:00:30,133
You're scared of
the seven dwarfs?

13
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:31,782
Just Doc. He's creepy.

14
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:33,650
I mean the guy went
to medical school.

15
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,070
What's he doing living
with six coal miners?

16
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,753
Oh, man! I'm so excited.
I couldn't sleep last night.

17
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:40,672
- I bet you guys couldn't either.
- Why?

18
00:00:40,688 --> 00:00:42,631
Only the Gala event
for the Grand Opening

19
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:45,493
of Sharper Image's 500th store.
Didn't you get my email?

20
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:48,001
No, I blocked your address
after the fourth time

21
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:51,450
you sent me the video of the
monkey sniffing his own butt.

22
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,971
Come on! It's on me.
I'm buying three of you foot massagers

23
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,570
and one of you a nose hair trimmer.
You know who you are.

24
00:00:56,887 --> 00:00:58,030
Come on, let's go.

25
00:00:58,046 --> 00:00:59,011
Okay, I'm in.

26
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:01,320
- To the Willowbrook Mall!
- To the Willowbrook Mall.

27
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:04,272
Oh, it's at a mall?
I'm not going.

28
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:05,521
What? Why not?

29
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:07,633
I just don't feel
like going to a mall.

30
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:09,563
We can split a Cinnabon.

31
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:11,370
No, I'm really not going to go.

32
00:01:11,388 --> 00:01:14,273
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- No, I don't go to malls!

33
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:18,600
Sorry, I just don't like malls.

34
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:20,242
Why not?

35
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:22,672
I'd rather not say.

36
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:24,821
- Sharper Images.
- But that's where clothes live.

37
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:26,922
Guys, guys, guys,
Robin doesn't like malls.

38
00:01:26,936 --> 00:01:29,320
If she doesn't want to tell us why,
she doesn't have to.

39
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:31,673
I think we should all
just respect her privacy.

40
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,103
Thanks, Ted.

41
00:01:33,115 --> 00:01:35,353
So, what's the deal
with you and malls?

42
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:37,163
I thought you said that,
if I didn't want to talk about it,

43
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:38,310
I didn't have to.

44
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:40,050
Yeah, with those people.

45
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,940
But I'm your boyfriend.
Come on. What is it?

46
00:01:41,955 --> 00:01:43,052
Did you get arrested at a mall?

47
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:43,702
No.

48
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:45,520
- Dumped at a mall?
- Ted.

49
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,632
Found out you were
Canadian at a mall?

50
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:48,613
Let it go.

51
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:50,321
Trapped under a fake
boulder at a mall?

52
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:52,600
- Let it go.
- Mauled at the mall?

53
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:54,001
Let it go!

54
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:58,120
And who gets trapped under
a fake boulder at the mall?

55
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:02,720
Not me in Ohio when I was nine,
that's for sure.

56
00:02:17,426 --> 00:02:20,823
I don't get it. Why won't Robin
tell me why she hates malls?

57
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,133
Ted, you should be happy
Robin has a secret.

58
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:24,502
The more you learn
about a person,

59
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:27,763
the better chance you have of
hitting the fatal "Oh" moment.

60
00:02:27,777 --> 00:02:28,890
The "Oh" moment?

61
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:32,663
Yeah, that moment when you find
out that one detail about a person

62
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:34,771
that is going to
be a deal breaker.

63
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:36,422
It's a promise ring.

64
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:39,951
I made a pact with God to stay
a virgin till I'm married.

65
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:44,183
I don't have an
eating disorder.

66
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:48,343
It's just when I put food in my mouth,
I chew it, and then I spit it out.

67
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:51,850
I just turned 30.

68
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:56,741
So trust me,
you want to postpone

69
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:59,622
knowing anything about each
other for as long as possible.

70
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,630
Mmm. I disagree.
If there is some potential "Oh" moment,

71
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:05,450
I want to know about it right away.
I mean, what's the alternative?

72
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:08,943
I now pronounce you,
man and wife.

73
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:12,653
I love you.

74
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:14,822
I used to be a dude.

75
00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:18,162
Yeah, I agree with Ted.

76
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:21,121
In a real relationship,
you share everything.

77
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:23,621
That's why Marshall and
I don't keep any secrets.

78
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,021
You are such a cutie pie.
Here's a quarter.

79
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:27,900
Go  play a song on the jukebox.

80
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,182
No, it's true.
They tell each other everything.

81
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:33,120
I can think of tons of things,
there's no way Marshall's told you.

82
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:34,343
Try me.

83
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:37,671
Do you know about the time
Marshall was in Trenton?

84
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:39,351
Donkey ate his pants. Yup.

85
00:03:39,368 --> 00:03:40,962
Bill's bachelor
party in Memphis?

86
00:03:40,976 --> 00:03:43,920
Oh, when they had to pump out
all the nickels from his stomach?

87
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:46,010
Wow. Okay. Seattle.

88
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,853
Trick question. Marshall's never
been to the Pacific Northwest

89
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:50,982
because he's afraid
of Sasquatch.

90
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:52,252
Damn, you're good.

91
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,802
I'm not afraid of Sasquatch,
I just think we should all be on alert.

92
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:59,540
Trust me. Not only do they
tell each other everything,

93
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:01,710
they want to know everything.

94
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:03,930
So after the shower I was brushing
my teeth. And I was like,

95
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,842
"Oh, man!
I wanted to have some orange juice.

96
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:07,180
I should have done that first."

97
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:08,850
But I already had the
toothpaste on the toothbrush.

98
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:11,361
So I just went ahead
and brushed them anyway.

99
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,520
What happened next?

100
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:18,330
Yeah, meanwhile,
Robin tells me nothing.

101
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,082
Fine. Do you want to know
what Robin's secret is?

102
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:22,170
You know?

103
00:04:22,188 --> 00:04:23,642
Of course I know.

104
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:25,571
She couldn't look at us,
her face got flushed--

105
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:27,223
that's shame, my friend.

106
00:04:27,238 --> 00:04:32,020
Our friend Robin used to do porn,
wait for it...

107
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,080
...ography.

108
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:36,750
Yeah, we didn't really
need to wait for that.

109
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:38,482
And it's ridiculous.

110
00:04:38,498 --> 00:04:40,002
I don't know.
He could be right.

111
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:42,702
She does have the fake
orgasm noises down.

112
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:43,493
Hey!

113
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:45,102
What? The walls are thin.

114
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:47,791
That's not what I'm
"hey"ing you about.

115
00:04:48,305 --> 00:04:49,802
You know what it might be?

116
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:53,751
This is going to sound a little
crazy but what if Robin is married?

117
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,401
Married? What does that
have to do with the mall?

118
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:59,090
Well, maybe she got
married at the mall.

119
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:00,792
Back home in Minnesota,
a ton of people get married

120
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:02,860
at the Mall of America.
It's great.

121
00:05:02,878 --> 00:05:05,581
There's this gorgeous indoor
golf course for pictures,

122
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,090
numerous fine dining options,
and talk about a reasonable--

123
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,153
- We are not getting married at the mall!
- Well, just meet with the guy.

124
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:13,820
She's not married.
Robin hates marriage.

125
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:16,252
Because she already
got married.

126
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,981
At the mall.

127
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:21,150
No,  because before Robin
moved to New York, she...

128
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:23,120
What was she doing?

129
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:25,302
Well, I don't know.
Whenever I ask her about Canada,

130
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:27,502
she kind of clams up.

131
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:29,360
She's  a pretty private person.

132
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,243
Except when she's
talking about...

133
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:34,800
Oh, a friend of mine in Canada
got married way too young

134
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:37,332
and it really turned
her off to marriage.

135
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:39,033
What do you think of
this wedding cake?

136
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,540
Oh, I like it.

137
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:42,062
Hey, you remember that
friend of mine in Canada

138
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:43,703
who got married way too young?

139
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:47,040
Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Fields'
giant cookie.

140
00:05:48,318 --> 00:05:49,623
No.

141
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:54,533
My friend in Canada who
got married way too young,

142
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:56,910
they had to do their vows twice,
once in French.

143
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:58,500
They speak French there, too?

144
00:05:58,513 --> 00:06:00,491
God, that place is a mess.

145
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:04,493
So you don't think there's
any "friend" from Canada?

146
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:05,802
Oh, I'm sure there is.

147
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:08,511
Just like I have a "friend" who
wet his bed till he was ten.

148
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:10,223
Use your brain, Ted.

149
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:15,032
Guys, there's no way
Robin is married.

150
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:16,781
It's ludicrous to
even suggest it.

151
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:19,040
- Thank you, Barney.
- 'Cause it's porn.

152
00:06:19,056 --> 00:06:20,711
I need another beer.

153
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:24,011
Robin was not in porn.
I bet you anything that she's married.

154
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:25,611
$20,000 says it's porn.

155
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:26,953
I don't have $20,000.

156
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:28,851
Well, then what do you have?

157
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:31,420
- Well...
- No.

158
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:34,873
I've got it.
The ultimate wager--

159
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:36,162
slap bet.

160
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:38,400
Oh, slap bet.
We used to do those when I was a kid.

161
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:39,720
What the hell's a slap bet?

162
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:41,713
Whoever is right gets to slap
the other person in the face

163
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:44,001
as hard as they possibly can--
but no rings.

164
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:46,691
Are you really going to do that?
That's so immature.

165
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,412
- You can be Slap Bet Commissioner.
- Ooh, I love it. What are my powers?

166
00:06:49,448 --> 00:06:52,483
Um, if a problem arises and we
need a ruling, that's your job.

167
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,273
But you have to be unbiased

168
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:57,532
and put the integrity of
slap bet above all else.

169
00:06:57,547 --> 00:07:00,273
This is an honor you will
take with you to your grave.

170
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:02,013
On your tombstone,
it will read,

171
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:05,350
"Lily Aldrin, caring wife,
loving friend,

172
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:07,340
Slap Bet Commissioner."

173
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:12,193
And your tombstone will read "Got
slapped by Marshall, so hard he died."

174
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:17,710
Okay. What if I just ask Robin
point blank if she has a husband?

175
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:19,821
You said you would
respect her privacy,

176
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:22,010
so maybe you should
just drop it.

177
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:23,892
Yeah, you're right.

178
00:07:25,798 --> 00:07:27,230
Husband.

179
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,771
There's no "P" in husband.

180
00:07:30,786 --> 00:07:33,771
Wow, you seem to know
a lot about husbands.

181
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:36,312
Fine. I'll take it back.

182
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:39,372
Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands,
this is great, you're going to love this.

183
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:42,003
Marshall, you know Marshall.
He thinks that the reason

184
00:07:42,016 --> 00:07:43,540
you didn't want to go to
the mall the other day

185
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:47,670
is because you got married at a
mall and have a husband in Canada.

186
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:51,440
I told him he's crazy.
Because he's crazy, right?

187
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:53,881
I mean, how crazy is that?

188
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,213
Are you asking me
if I'm married?

189
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:57,492
Well, you can ask me.

190
00:07:57,507 --> 00:07:59,630
Nope, I'm not married.
Your turn.

191
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,751
What happened to
respecting my privacy?

192
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:04,422
Look, just say, "No,
I'm not married."

193
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:06,253
Ted, I don't understand
why you can't--

194
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,813
Just say, "No,
I'm not married."

195
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:10,462
I can't.

196
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:12,482
Marshall's right.

197
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:17,280
I was young and I got married.

198
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,262
It was a mistake and
he moved away, but...

199
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:22,101
yeah. I'm married.

200
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,052
You have a husband?

201
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:34,992
I was young and stupid

202
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:38,270
and we got married at a mall
and we broke up at a mall

203
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:41,030
and I...
I haven't been to a mall since.

204
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:42,401
Why didn't you get divorced?

205
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:44,873
He moved to Hong Kong for
work and I was like...

206
00:08:44,886 --> 00:08:46,291
eh, good enough.

207
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:48,511
Good enough?
That's not good enough.

208
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:51,621
You  order pancakes, you get waffles,
that's good enough.

209
00:08:51,637 --> 00:08:54,823
Look, I haven't
seen him in years.

210
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:57,680
It's just a part of my
life I want to forget.

211
00:08:58,108 --> 00:09:00,982
Just please don't tell
anyone about this.

212
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:03,692
Okay.

213
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:09,242
Dude, your hand is monstrous.

214
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:11,960
Yeah, well, what'd you expect?
You've seen my penis.

215
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:16,233
I can't believe you
told us Robin's secret.

216
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:18,810
What? How could I keep
something like that to myself?

217
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:20,171
And you begged me to tell you.

218
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:21,630
No, I didn't.

219
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:24,680
Please tell us. Just tell us.
I'm begging you.

220
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:26,893
Tell us. Tell us. Tell us.
Please please please--

221
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:29,390
Fine. Robin's married.

222
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:33,481
Yeah, well,
you still shouldn't have told us.

223
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,402
I mean,
what kind of boyfriend are you?

224
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,422
See that's just it,
I'm not the boyfriend.

225
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:38,843
I'm the mistress.

226
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:40,293
No, not the mistress.

227
00:09:40,306 --> 00:09:41,790
The mastress.

228
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:43,340
The master.
What do you call it?

229
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:45,450
Uh, pretty sure we're
going to call it mistress.

230
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:49,651
What am I going to do?
My girlfriend's married.

231
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:51,203
Do I ask her to get a divorce?

232
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:54,381
Ted, even if she is married,
it's a Canadian marriage.

233
00:09:54,398 --> 00:09:56,451
It's like their money,
or their army.

234
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,510
Nobody takes it seriously.

235
00:09:58,525 --> 00:09:59,711
It's serious to me.

236
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:01,622
You know what, in some countries,
if you been separated

237
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:04,373
for longer than five years,
technically, you're no longer married.

238
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:06,932
I can check it out at the
law library at school.

239
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:11,860
I can see my hand
print on your face.

240
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:14,591
Don't get too cocky, Slappy.

241
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:17,663
I just got a shipment of porn
from Canada I have to go through.

242
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:19,672
I won the bet.
Why are you still searching?

243
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,481
Just because you were right
doesn't mean I'm wrong.

244
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:24,842
Oh, right, like you need
an excuse to watch porn.

245
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:27,091
Canadian porn.

246
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:29,640
Trust me when I tell you their
universal health care system

247
00:10:29,655 --> 00:10:32,092
doesn't cover breast implants.

248
00:10:32,177 --> 00:10:35,093
If I have to sit through one
more flat-chested Nova Scotian

249
00:10:35,107 --> 00:10:37,380
riding a Mountie on
the back of a Zamboni

250
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:39,860
I'll go out of my mind.

251
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,652
- Hey.
- Hey.

252
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:46,851
Listen, dude,
I got to talk to you,

253
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:50,022
but you got to promise me
that you won't tell Barney.

254
00:10:50,038 --> 00:10:52,541
Fine, I won't tell Barney.
What is it?

255
00:10:53,816 --> 00:10:56,301
- Robin's not married.
- What?

256
00:10:56,317 --> 00:10:57,800
Why would she tell me she was?

257
00:10:57,818 --> 00:10:59,960
I don't know, but I cross-
checked every record in Canada.

258
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:01,852
There's no record of
her ever being married.

259
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:02,992
There must be some mistake.

260
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:04,810
I promise you.
She's not married.

261
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:07,172
She's not great at
parking legally either.

262
00:11:07,618 --> 00:11:11,040
So she lied to me?
W--What am I going to do?

263
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:14,080
I-I can't confront her,
'cause then she'll know I told you.

264
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,372
You got to lawyer her.

265
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,931
You got to ask her a bunch of questions,
try to trip her up,

266
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:20,523
maybe make her feel guilty,
whatever it takes

267
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:22,363
to get a confession out of her.

268
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:25,702
Thanks for telling
me your secret.

269
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:28,171
It means so much to me,
that you could be so--

270
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,023
God, what's the word
I'm looking for?

271
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:31,181
Honest.

272
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:32,982
Mm, thanks, Ted.

273
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:35,132
Yeah.  You know what's probably
the best part about your honesty?

274
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:37,003
How truthful it is.

275
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:39,121
I say we just move on.

276
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,273
Well, for me to get total
closure on this whole

277
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:44,492
"my girlfriend has
a husband" thing,

278
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:46,251
I think I might need a
little bit more information,

279
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,192
like what month did
you get married?

280
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:50,040
June. We had a June wedding.

281
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:52,400
Ah, Canada in June.

282
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:54,231
That's the dream.

283
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:57,072
Sit-down or buffet?

284
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,851
Well, it's...
weird that you don't remember.

285
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:03,031
No, I just didn't
know how to answer

286
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:05,991
because we did butlered hors
d'oeuvres in the atrium,

287
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:09,033
but the actual dinner was
a buffet in the Food Court

288
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:12,432
featuring a filet mignon or a
roasted potato-crusted salmon

289
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:15,172
with a lobster
scallion beurre blanc.

290
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:19,652
Band or DJ?

291
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:21,831
A string quartet played
at the ceremony,

292
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:24,842
but for the actual reception,
we had a seven-piece band.

293
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,600
We paid extra for the sax

294
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:30,151
'cause I just love that
smooth alto sound.

295
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:31,840
- How many bridesmaids?
- Seven.

296
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:33,161
- Flowers?
- Azaleas.

297
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:35,460
- Color scheme?
- Dusty rose and sienna.

298
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:37,261
Husband's name.

299
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:41,503
- You were never married!
- Yes, I was.

300
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:43,442
- No, you weren't.
- How do you know?

301
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,843
I looked it up at the library.

302
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:48,433
- What library?
- The one on Fifth.

303
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:50,351
- When did you go?
- Today at lunch,

304
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:52,400
and I had an apple brie
panini with potato salad...

305
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,643
I'm not questioning
the lunch part, Ted.

306
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:56,250
What database did you use?

307
00:12:56,267 --> 00:13:00,990
I used the Canadian
Mall Marriage 6000.

308
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:03,871
Fine, Marshall looked
it up at school.

309
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:06,020
- You told Marshall?!
- You lied to me!

310
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,930
See, this is why I don't
tell people secrets.

311
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:10,490
You were supposed to be the
one person I trusted the most

312
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:12,172
and even you couldn't
keep a secret.

313
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:13,500
But it was a fake secret.

314
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:15,783
Yeah, I was testing
you and you failed.

315
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,171
And now you're never gonna know
why I don't go to the mall.

316
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:20,191
And it's good, too.

317
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:22,092
You were testing me?
That's insane.

318
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:24,871
Oh, yeah? How long did it
take for you to tell Marshall

319
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:27,723
my biggest secret in the world?
Five minutes?

320
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:30,593
- That wasn't a real secret!
- Yeah, but it could have been.

321
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:31,953
You are driving me crazy!

322
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:33,872
No wonder your fake
husband moved to Hong Kong.

323
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:36,143
He moved there for business.

324
00:13:37,746 --> 00:13:38,882
You.

325
00:13:38,897 --> 00:13:40,633
You got something to say to me?

326
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,453
What are you talking about?

327
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:45,493
I know Robin was
never really married.

328
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:48,422
How could you
possibly know that?

329
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:55,680
And then I put on my
pajamas and got into bed.

330
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:57,291
How about you?

331
00:13:57,528 --> 00:14:00,643
Oh, let's see, uh,
first I took the subway to school.

332
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:01,942
Then I got a bagel.

333
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,310
Then I went to the library and
found out Robin was never married.

334
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,441
Crazy.

335
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:07,551
Then I was hungry again,
so I went down to the vending machine,

336
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:10,722
but by the time I got down there,
I wasn't even hungry anymore.

337
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:14,102
- You told him?
- I had to.

338
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:16,450
I'm Slap Bet Commissioner.

339
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:19,561
Believe me, this hurts me more
than it's gonna hurt you.

340
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:22,491
Don't count on it.
I've been practicing on a tree trunk.

341
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:26,013
- Barney gets three slaps.
- Three?

342
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:30,073
One because you lied and two
for being prematurely slapped.

343
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:31,211
Three slaps.

344
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:32,312
But--

345
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:38,222
Oh, my God.

346
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:40,763
- Are you gonna cry?
- No.

347
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:42,771
You're gonna cry.

348
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:48,131
I just don't think it's healthy to
keep big secrets in a relationship.

349
00:14:48,147 --> 00:14:50,051
My parents didn't really talk
to each other for 30 years

350
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:51,161
and now they're divorced.

351
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:52,971
I have shared more
of myself with you

352
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:55,080
than I've ever
shared with anyone.

353
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:57,233
I'm asking for this one secret,

354
00:14:57,246 --> 00:15:01,010
which has nothing to do with us,
to just be mine.

355
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:05,682
So I just got a very
interesting phone call.

356
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,110
What are you talking about?

357
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,900
I know Robin's secret.

358
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,532
- What?
- That's right.

359
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:12,302
I know your secret, Robin.

360
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:16,111
Or should I say Robin Sparkles?

361
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:18,032
How do you know that name?

362
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:19,923
Because I know the truth,

363
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:22,510
and I am about to show
it to you right now.

364
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:24,221
Gather 'round, Ted,
you're gonna want to see this.

365
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,683
Yeah, no, I don't.

366
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,611
What?

367
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,140
Robin wants to keep
this a secret, so...

368
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:30,921
it's gonna stay a secret.

369
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,701
Yeah, it's not
gonna stay a secret.

370
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:35,080
You see, in my research,

371
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:37,471
I came upon a certain
gentleman in Malaysia

372
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:40,250
who is in possession of
a certain videotape.

373
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:42,540
He just emailed me that
it will be up and running

374
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:46,060
on My Space in about...
right now.

375
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:50,740
Robin's world is about to
be turned upside-down.

376
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:52,260
I mean, I'm guessing.

377
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:53,412
Barney, don't, okay?

378
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:55,511
Robin, please don't panic.

379
00:15:55,526 --> 00:15:57,540
I'm only gonna show enough to
prove to Marshall I was right.

380
00:15:57,577 --> 00:15:59,802
No, Barney,
I said we're not watching this.

381
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:01,600
No, it's time.

382
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:03,463
Look, I appreciate what
you're trying to do,

383
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:06,881
but if it's out there, there's no
point in trying to hide it anymore.

384
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:09,671
Let's just watch it
and be done with it.

385
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:12,002
Are you as terrified as I am?

386
00:16:12,368 --> 00:16:14,912
I don't want to
get slapped again.

387
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:19,840
I want to stress
that I was young.

388
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:21,050
Yeah, you were.

389
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:22,421
And I didn't know any better.

390
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:23,981
They never do.

391
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:26,643
And it started out as an
innocent modeling job.

392
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:28,673
It  always does.

393
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:31,443
Please, Mr. Johnson.

394
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,823
I'm sorry I was a bad girl.

395
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:36,491
Please don't give me detention.

396
00:16:36,838 --> 00:16:41,431
Isn't there something I can
do to make it up to you?

397
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:46,920
Oh, my God.

398
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:48,933
Well, obviously,
I've been proven right,

399
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:50,993
so in the interest
of Robin's dignity,

400
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:52,263
I won't show anymore.

401
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,071
Plus, it's getting late.
It's already slap o'clock.

402
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:58,073
What the hell was that?

403
00:16:58,088 --> 00:17:00,810
Uh, I slap bet Marshall that
you did porn, so I win.

404
00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:04,770
Porn? I wish it was porn.
It would be less embarrassing.

405
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:07,341
I know.

406
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:10,992
How about I sing you a song?

407
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:20,171
Let's go to the
mall, everybody!

408
00:17:26,055 --> 00:17:29,443
I was a teenage
pop star in Canada.

409
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:32,050
# Put on your jelly bracelets #

410
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:34,103
# And your cool graffiti coat #

411
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:35,742
# At the mall, having fun #

412
00:17:35,758 --> 00:17:38,803
# Is what it's all about #

413
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:42,140
This is the most amazing
thing I've ever seen.

414
00:17:42,156 --> 00:17:44,050
- That's you?
- Yes.

415
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,902
I had one minor hit.

416
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:49,923
I had to go all over Canada
and sing this song in malls.

417
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:54,093
For a whole year, I lived off of
Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.

418
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,742
# Everybody come and play #

419
00:17:57,757 --> 00:18:01,940
# Throw every last care away #

420
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:05,223
# Let's go to the mall #

421
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:07,221
# Today #

422
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:11,331
If this is the '90s,
why does it look like 1986?

423
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:15,080
The '80s didn't come to Canada till,
like, '93.

424
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:19,932
Taking a break from the first of many,
many viewings,

425
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:22,502
I can't help but notice
that this isn't porn.

426
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:25,312
And yet,
a slap occurred without the permission

427
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:27,353
of the Slap Bet Commissioner.

428
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:31,042
Looks like somebody suffered
from premature slapulation.

429
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:32,563
Oh, my God, Robin's rapping.

430
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:33,880
Guys, Robin's rapping.

431
00:18:33,898 --> 00:18:35,742
# Went to the mall with #
# a couple of friends #

432
00:18:35,756 --> 00:18:38,083
# I had a whole week's #
# allowance to spend #

433
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:40,361
Okay, I'm going to
give you a choice.

434
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:43,000
Either ten slaps
right now in a row,

435
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:45,540
or five slaps that
can be doled out

436
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:49,103
at any point from
here to eternity.

437
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:50,530
You go with the ten now.

438
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:52,510
No way,
why get ten when you can get five?

439
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:54,542
Yeah, but the constant fear of
knowing that at any moment,

440
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:56,302
you could get slapped in the face,
would drive you crazy.

441
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:57,951
I'm going to go with
the five for eternity.

442
00:18:57,987 --> 00:19:00,571
- Good call.
- Horrible call.

443
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:04,502
Relax, dude,
I'm just going for my soda, man.

444
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:05,392
Take it easy.

445
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:07,330
This is going to be fun.

446
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:10,383
# Let's go to the mall #

447
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:13,083
# Let's go to the mall #

448
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:14,782
# Today #

449
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:16,971
So just to be clear,

450
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:21,070
you wanted everybody to
go to the mall today?

451
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:25,063
Wow, we're going to
watch this a lot.

452
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:28,390
I can't believe I ever wore
a Bedazzled jean jacket.

453
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:30,012
Hey, just so you know,

454
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:32,713
16-year-old me would
have been all over you.

455
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:35,883
You could have been the girlfriend
in Canada I told everyone I had.

456
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,710
Hey, uh, I'm really sorry
I pried this out of you.

457
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:40,630
I probably should
have left it alone.

458
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:42,593
You know what?

459
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:44,413
You know me better now.

460
00:19:45,176 --> 00:19:47,071
That feels kind of nice.

461
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,213
That's one.

462
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:03,321
# Everybody come and play #

463
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:06,891
# Throw every last care away #

464
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:07,773
Wow.

465
00:20:07,787 --> 00:20:10,712
# Let's go to the mall #

466
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:12,482
# Today #

467
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:14,121
Did you have to laugh
like that every time?

468
00:20:14,155 --> 00:20:15,512
Yes.

469
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:17,820
# This boy I like #

470
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:19,652
# Met him at the food court #

471
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:21,153
# He's got hair like Gretzky #

472
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:23,703
# And he does jumps #
# on his skateboard #

473
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:25,812
# I hope he asks me out #

474
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:27,692
# Take me to my favorite spot #

475
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,333
# It'll be just him and me #

476
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:32,451
# But don't forget the robot #

477
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:34,863
The robot. Hey!

478
00:20:36,198 --> 00:20:38,910
# But, baby #
# I don't want to wait #

479
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:39,650
# Let's do it #

480
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,242
No, she doesn't want to wait.

481
00:20:41,257 --> 00:20:43,191
# I'm gonna rock #
# your body anyway #

482
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:45,842
# I'm gonna rock your #
# body till Canada Day #

483
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:51,313
# Everybody come and play #

484
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:55,150
# Throw every last care away #

485
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:58,731
# Let's go to the mall #

486
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:03,493
# Today, today, today, today #

487
00:21:03,817 --> 00:21:05,730
# Let's go to the mall #

488
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:07,692
# Let's go to the ma-a-all #
