1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:04,088
<i>Kids, never underestimate
the power of destiny.</i>

2
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:06,619
<i>Because when you least expect it,
the littlest thing</i>

3
00:00:06,729 --> 00:00:09,668
<i>can cause a ripple effect
that changes your life.</i>

4
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:12,287
<i>Take for instance
my trip to Chicago.</i>

5
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:14,803
That security guard was
a little bit handsy.

6
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:16,896
That's funny.
She barely touched me.

7
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:18,975
Uh, Gate 23. Come on.

8
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,774
If we miss this flight,
I will never forgive myself.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,135
<i>Why was this flight
so important?</i>

10
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:27,300
<i>Let's back up a few months
to the fall of 2006.</i>

11
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:29,888
<i>I had just sold my first
building design and become</i>

12
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:32,683
<i>the youngest project manager
in my firm's history.</i>

13
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:34,914
<i>Suddenly I was
being headhunted.</i>

14
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:38,490
<i>One firm was even considering me to
run their entire New York office.</i>

15
00:00:38,768 --> 00:00:42,701
<i>They were flying me in for a final interview
at their corporate headquarters in Chicago.</i>

16
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>It was the opportunity
of a lifetime.</i>

17
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:47,832
<i>It was my destiny.
There was just one problem.</i>

18
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:49,860
Hi, wait, two more.

19
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,802
Sorry, you're too late,
I already shut the doors.

20
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:54,061
Well, I'm sure if we pull
real hard we can open them.

21
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:57,000
Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but see, once 
I close those doors, that's it.

22
00:00:57,038 --> 00:00:59,162
Nobody else is allowed
down that jet-way.

23
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:02,033
Except for that guy.

24
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:06,492
Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss
the chance to interview for my dream job.

25
00:01:06,506 --> 00:01:07,621
I'm sorry, sir.

26
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:10,530
His dream job!
Didn't you ever have a dream job?

27
00:01:10,548 --> 00:01:13,163
Something from when you were a little
girl, that was all you wanted to do?

28
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:17,441
I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to 
bed at night dreaming about being a...

29
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,511
I mean, uh...

30
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:21,722
This is a cool job.

31
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,220
Please, I have to
be on this flight.

32
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:27,012
I'll see what I can do.
But it doesn't look good.

33
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:28,620
Thanks.

34
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:30,763
Your uniforms are pretty.

35
00:01:57,857 --> 00:01:59,281
Okay.

36
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,753
They haven't armed the doors yet,
so you still have a chance.

37
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:04,123
It's up to the captain now
and they're calling us back.

38
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:06,323
Great, please let us know
soon as you hear anything.

39
00:02:06,338 --> 00:02:08,560
Sure, and for the future,
we recommend you arrive

40
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:11,181
at the airport an hour and
a half before your flight,

41
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:13,131
not, you know,
one minute after.

42
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:15,112
Normally, I'm
incredibly responsible.

43
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:17,140
I just had to go to court this
morning and get sentenced.

44
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:19,703
Not that I'm a
criminal or anything.

45
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:21,731
Yeah, he just jumped
a subway turnstile.

46
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:25,022
You seem to have a lot of problems
with the rules of travel.

47
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:27,912
Hello?

48
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,743
Oh, that is great news.

49
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:34,842
It's my mom--
she found her missing earring.

50
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:36,952
Have a seat.
I'll call you when I hear something.

51
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:38,943
Where was it?

52
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:40,953
That thing better
have call waiting.

53
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:43,332
Could you just call the firm
and explain what happened?

54
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:46,841
It's down to three people and I know they need to
make their decision today.

55
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:50,232
I sort of feel my not showing up
might put me at a disadvantage.

56
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,111
I'm so stupid.

57
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,223
Why did I have to
jump that turnstile?

58
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:57,923
Hey, don't be so
hard on yourself.

59
00:02:57,936 --> 00:03:00,800
And isn't this whole thing
really Barney's fault?

60
00:03:00,908 --> 00:03:04,070
<i>She had a point.
It was kind of Barney's fault.</i>

61
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:06,362
<i>Let's back up a few months.</i>

62
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:08,471
Oh, Marshall,
how's the broken toe?

63
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,670
Oh, man, it kills.
You  want some aspirin, baby?

64
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:14,293
You know I don't
believe in pain killers.

65
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:18,161
Wow, your first broken bone.

66
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:20,062
Kind of kills your whole
"Unbreakable" theory.

67
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:22,773
Marshall used to think
he was indestructible.

68
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:25,251
Well, it added up.
I've never broken anything.

69
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:27,511
I've never been sick,
and when I need to,

70
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:29,612
I can summon
incredible strength.

71
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:32,190
Ted, tell her the story
of the really heavy door.

72
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:35,473
There was a really heavy door.
He opened it.

73
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:37,652
On one pull.

74
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:42,172
Well, you must be really bummed, you're
not gonna be able to run tomorrow.

75
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:43,580
Yeah. It sucks,

76
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:46,960
all that work I put in training
for the marathon was a total waste.

77
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:48,972
Training for a marathon.

78
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:51,392
What?

79
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:54,232
You don't need to train for a marathon.
You just run it.

80
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:56,021
You're kidding, right?

81
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,792
Not at all. I could run a
marathon anytime I wanted to.

82
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:01,942
So like tomorrow, you think you
could wake up, roll out of bed,

83
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:04,710
and just run the New York City Marathon?
Absolutely.

84
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:07,771
Barney, we're talking
about 42 kilometers.

85
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:10,231
Thanks, Canada.
I'll take it from here.

86
00:04:10,245 --> 00:04:12,381
Barney, it's like 26 miles.

87
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:14,322
Here's how you run a marathon.

88
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,590
Step one, you start running.

89
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,090
There is no step two.

90
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:21,773
Okay, you know what? Prove it.

91
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:23,771
Take my number and
run in my place.

92
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:27,170
I will bet you 50 bucks you
don't even finish the race.

93
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:28,523
50 bucks?

94
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:32,963
Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself
an ice-cream cone.

95
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:35,593
Make it $10,000.

96
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:37,952
You have a gambling problem.
You'll bet me 50.

97
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:40,912
Fine, then no bet.
Okay, $50.

98
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:45,680
<i>The next morning,
as the marathon began,</i>

99
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:47,881
<i>we were focused on
Marshall's computer.</i>

100
00:04:47,897 --> 00:04:50,452
Each runner gets a tracking chip
so you can follow them online,

101
00:04:50,468 --> 00:04:53,462
see when they pass certain checkpoints.
Barney's got mine in his shoe.

102
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:57,680
Ooh, he's starting!
This ought to be good.

103
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:06,900
He's already passing
the second checkpoint.

104
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:09,313
This tracking thing is amazing.

105
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:12,172
When we get married,
you're getting one of these.

106
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:20,443
Wow. Look at his time.
It's pretty impressive.

107
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:23,770
He's gotta be cheating, okay.
He knew we'd check.

108
00:05:23,787 --> 00:05:25,390
Yeah, he'll do
anything to win a bet.

109
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,851
Remember that time he bet me that Men
at Work sang "Hungry Like the Wolf,"

110
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:31,460
and when he found out that they didn't,
he tried to hire them to?

111
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:34,900
Well, it looks like, "Barney" should
be coming over the Queensboro Bridge

112
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,153
and up First Avenue within
the next hour or so. But...

113
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,702
there is no way that
that's really him.

114
00:05:40,878 --> 00:05:42,900
It's really him.

115
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,800
Hey! That's mine.

116
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,010
Yeah, you'd better run!

117
00:05:56,996 --> 00:06:00,142
- What up, non-finishers?
- Wow.

118
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:02,442
- Very impressive, Barney.
- Right?

119
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:04,480
Yeah, my time would have been
like a half an hour better,

120
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:07,272
but I met this total hottie on
Mile Seven. We took a quick detour

121
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,840
and had our own mini
marathon behind a Nathan's.

122
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,743
I  won.

123
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:14,630
I'm not sure anyone in
that story is a winner.

124
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:18,000
So where's my 50 bucks?

125
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:19,990
All right.

126
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:23,192
I got to admit,
you earned this.

127
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:27,990
Huh? Can't believe they haven't
made a coin for this yet.

128
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:31,943
Anyway, I'm heading home.
Might go hit the gym.

129
00:06:32,507 --> 00:06:36,570
Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners 
get to use the subway for free today.

130
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:39,943
Wow. You know I really should
check out this "subway."

131
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:43,691
Heard so much about it.
Wow. Look at me. Slumming it.

132
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:46,552
Maybe I'll make a
weekend out of it

133
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:49,043
and I'll call my bridge
and tunnel girl tonight.

134
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:51,142
You're dating a girl
from New Jersey?

135
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:52,983
No.

136
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:59,172
<i>So Barney did it.
He actually finished the marathon.</i>

137
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:02,622
<i>But a little while later...
I got an interesting phone call.</i>

138
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,331
- Hello?
- Ted, it's Barney.

139
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:06,762
Listen to me, I need you to come
and pick me up on the subway.

140
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,500
What, what are
you talking about?

141
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:11,413
I was sitting here,
totally minding my own business.

142
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:19,600
Finisher.

143
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:22,031
Yeah, you know what I mean.

144
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:24,130
86th street.

145
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,883
My legs don't work.

146
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:50,910
I've already ridden the
subway twice end to end.

147
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:53,001
I've seen where
it turns around.

148
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:56,791
Ted, you don't ever want to see
where the subway turns around.

149
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:00,101
Barney's legs won't work.

150
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:03,890
He's riding the subway from end to end
because he physically can't get off the train.

151
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:06,083
Best 50 bucks I ever spent.

152
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,341
Listen to me, Ted.

153
00:08:07,357 --> 00:08:10,341
I'm going to lose you any second.
I'm on the fourth car of the six train

154
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:12,663
heading south from Pelham
Bay Park in the Bronx.

155
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:15,580
Meet me at the 86th Street station in,
like, half an hour?

156
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,702
All right. I'll be right there.

157
00:08:17,715 --> 00:08:19,662
Stay where you are.

158
00:08:39,695 --> 00:08:43,493
Oh, come on. You're not even going
to give up your seat for him?

159
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:47,642
I'm sorry. I can't.

160
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:49,592
Douche.

161
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:07,233
- Barney?!
- Ted!

162
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:16,490
No...!

163
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:20,380
See? If Barney never
tried to run the marathon,

164
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:22,130
you  never would have
jumped that turnstile,

165
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:25,883
you wouldn't have had that court date today,
and we would have made this flight.

166
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:29,042
You're right.
Everything can be traced back to him.

167
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:31,982
Like that rash we
all got at Christmas.

168
00:09:32,987 --> 00:09:35,011
All right,
I have to see what's going on.

169
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:38,720
- So I was able to get you two seats.
- Really? That's great!

170
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:41,592
No, no, not you. I'm talking to
my mom about Blue Man Group.

171
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,403
Ma, can I call you back?

172
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,493
Okay, what about our flight?
Can we get on?

173
00:09:45,508 --> 00:09:47,591
I'm still waiting for... Huh.

174
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:49,762
Looks like your
flight left already.

175
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:52,390
What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no.
I have to be in Chicago today.

176
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:54,120
Well, he never even
called you back?

177
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:56,522
Well, it's typical pilot.
They don't call you back at work

178
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:59,220
and they don't call you back after
you spend two nights with them

179
00:09:59,257 --> 00:10:01,240
at a Radisson in Orlando.

180
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:08,620
<i>It turned out there was one other
flight that would just barely get me</i>

181
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:10,500
<i>to Chicago on time
for my job interview,</i>

182
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:13,503
<i>but it was all the way on the
other side of the airport.</i>

183
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,431
What was the name of
the airline again?

184
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,291
I think it was something
like Flights R' Us.

185
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:19,753
Was the "R" backwards?
God, I hope not.

186
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:23,181
- Geez.
- Stupid smart carts.

187
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:25,522
More  like dumb carts.

188
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:27,933
If we miss this flight,
it's all Barney's fault.

189
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:31,361
You know, Barney never would have
run the marathon in the first place

190
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:33,670
- if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.
- Yeah, so?

191
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,991
What, you think
this is my fault?

192
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:41,330
<i>For Marshall, the initial idea to run
the marathon came way back in April.</i>

193
00:10:41,347 --> 00:10:43,371
My pants are starting
to feel a little tight.

194
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:46,970
Oh, that's okay.
I love that cute little belly.

195
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:53,671
I cannot allow this.

196
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:55,472
What?

197
00:10:56,185 --> 00:11:00,183
I am going to run the
New York City Marathon.

198
00:11:10,155 --> 00:11:12,793
"It is important to load
up on carbohydrates

199
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,751
two to four hours
before a big run.

200
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:18,031
Try  a breakfast of a bagel,
a banana,

201
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:21,102
oatmeal, strawberries
and some orange juice."

202
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:23,850
Here you go, Marshmallow.
Just like the book said.

203
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:27,683
Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating
all of my breakfast runner-style.

204
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:29,610
Liquids are digested faster.

205
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,691
That way, no energy is wasted,

206
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:34,291
and it's all about the run.

207
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:08,433
"Don't forget to give yourself
plenty of positive reinforcement."

208
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:11,773
This is gonna be
your best run yet.

209
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:16,043
You're going to accomplish
all of your goals.

210
00:12:16,815 --> 00:12:19,533
You are a robot sent
from the future

211
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:21,553
to win the marathon!

212
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:25,603
You are... Marshall.

213
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:29,393
You are... Marshall.

214
00:12:29,437 --> 00:12:33,603
You are Marshall! Yeah!

215
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:42,851
"Chafing or blisters can
occur in a number of areas,

216
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:46,481
including the feet, armpits,
or even the nipples.

217
00:12:46,495 --> 00:12:50,402
Try using some petroleum
jelly on the affected areas."

218
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:12,171
Oh, gosh!

219
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:29,181
Dude, you are a
terrific runner.

220
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:34,151
Tomorrow you're gonna run and
finish the New York City Marathon!

221
00:13:34,908 --> 00:13:36,890
You're the best.

222
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,140
You look good.

223
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:42,340
Nobody does it better than you.

224
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,392
Marshall? Oh, my God!

225
00:13:45,637 --> 00:13:47,620
So, yes, it was your fault.

226
00:13:47,635 --> 00:13:49,902
I mean, if you don't show up at the
apartment in the middle of the day,

227
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:52,590
Marshall doesn't break his toe,
Barney doesn't run in his place,

228
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:54,660
I don't jump the turnstile
and get a court date,

229
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:56,723
and we make our flight
in plenty of time!

230
00:13:58,785 --> 00:14:01,601
And I don't fall down and bite
my tongue at the airport.

231
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:03,690
That really wasn't my fault.

232
00:14:03,705 --> 00:14:05,951
I wouldn't have walked in on
Marshall if it weren't for Lily.

233
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:07,862
Hey, think about it.

234
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:11,421
Hey, what's going on here?
Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.

235
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:12,751
Yeah, but for what?

236
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,592
I don't know. Usually there's a
Stormtrooper or Klingon in line

237
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:19,551
"Annual wedding dress blowout.

238
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,721
Designer sample
dresses up to 90% off.

239
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:25,791
Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m."

240
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:28,930
Oh, my God. Can you believe what some
nut bags will do to save a few bucks?

241
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:31,090
We have to camp out.

242
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:32,973
- Are you serious?
- You don't understand.

243
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:35,390
This is an amazing sale.
I've heard about it before,

244
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,392
but I never knew where it was.

245
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:41,000
We'll have a wedding dress campout.
It'll be fun.

246
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:43,472
I can't go.
I've got this thing.

247
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:45,660
- What thing?
- A penis.

248
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:48,770
- This is the place.
- Oh, wow.

249
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:52,261
Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet!

250
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:53,741
Vera Wang!

251
00:14:53,755 --> 00:14:57,822
Oh, Robin, do you have any idea
what you guys stumbled onto here?

252
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,683
You said wang.

253
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:05,991
Oh, this reminds me of the ticket
line to Lilith Fair, 1998.

254
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:07,801
Only fewer mullets.

255
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:12,593
You should feel good. You're only, like,
the tenth craziest bride in New York.

256
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:17,533
Ooh, this is comfy.

257
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:20,001
We might actually
be able to sleep.

258
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:23,101
That's kind of annoying.

259
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:27,371
Well, I'm sure somebody will be
out here to turn it off any minute.

260
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,012
I don't think I can take this.

261
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:47,471
Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't
turn on again,

262
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:49,702
but then it does.

263
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:53,421
Why does it, Robin?
Why does it keep turning on?

264
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:55,471
It's gonna be okay,
sweetie. Why...

265
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,251
Why don't we make a
game out of it, okay?

266
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:00,220
Why don't we sing along?

267
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:22,550
If we get through this,

268
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:26,031
I swear I'm gonna live
my life differently.

269
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:30,341
I just want to tell my parents
I love them one more time.

270
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:33,641
Morning, ladies.

271
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:38,602
- It's him. It's the car guy!
- Get out of here!

272
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,243
<i>The next morning, Robin was too tired
to go all the way back to Brooklyn,</i>

273
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:53,071
<i>so while I was at work,</i>

274
00:16:53,085 --> 00:16:55,551
<i>she went to crash at my
apartment for a couple hours,</i>

275
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:57,472
<i>and that's when...</i>

276
00:16:57,588 --> 00:16:59,951
Nobody does it better than you.

277
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:02,013
Marshall?! Oh, my God!

278
00:17:03,176 --> 00:17:06,173
So if Lily hadn't dragged me
down to the wedding dress store,

279
00:17:06,188 --> 00:17:07,881
we would have made
the first flight.

280
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:10,570
Oh, thank God.
The doors are still open. We made it.

281
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:14,681
Hi. Please.
We really need to get on this flight.

282
00:17:14,795 --> 00:17:16,751
Oh, my God!

283
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:19,183
You're that reporter
from Metro News 1.

284
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:20,822
Yes, yes, I am.

285
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:22,922
I can't believe
you recognized me.

286
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:25,630
- You did that story on the giant pizzas?
- Would you check to see

287
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:27,763
- if you have any more seats?
- One moment, sir.

288
00:17:28,218 --> 00:17:30,643
Were those pizzas real?
Come on, were they?

289
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:32,882
- Robin...
- One second, Ted.

290
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:34,960
Um, you know,
a lot of people ask me that.

291
00:17:34,977 --> 00:17:37,290
The truth is,
the pizzas were real.

292
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,370
- Calzones. Trick photography.
- I knew it!

293
00:17:40,386 --> 00:17:43,371
God, it is so nice
to meet a fan!

294
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:46,400
And I would be a fan of your
work if you could get us

295
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,401
two seats on that next flight.

296
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:52,961
Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing 
up their final seat count.

297
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,203
Let me see what I can find out.

298
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:57,933
Would it help if I got on and gave an
impassioned speech about my destiny?

299
00:17:57,968 --> 00:17:59,973
I think it might hurt.

300
00:18:02,726 --> 00:18:04,893
This is such a nightmare.

301
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:09,032
Okay, so we agree? This goes
back to Lily wanting to camp out

302
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:11,030
for a wedding dress?

303
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,152
No.
Wait. It goes back further.

304
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,102
Remember why we were eating
hot dogs on the East Side?

305
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:29,731
1939?!

306
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:32,792
This penny's from 1939!

307
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:37,580
A 67-year-old penny.

308
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:40,511
Do you realize this penny was
minted during World War II?

309
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:43,840
Oh, so was my grandfather,
but that doesn't make him interesting.

310
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:46,451
Look, I know a little
something about coins,

311
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:48,690
and this baby is worth
something to a collector.

312
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:50,841
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

313
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:55,083
You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner
with the money I get for this little guy.

314
00:18:55,095 --> 00:18:57,352
<i>And that's exactly what I did.</i>

315
00:18:57,367 --> 00:19:00,971
You're lucky there's still a place that
serves anything for a dollar fifty.

316
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:04,040
Hey, that's 150 times
its original value.

317
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:07,591
Actually, the meal
was only $1.49.

318
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:10,112
1984.

319
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:12,920
Hey, in 50 years,
we can get dinner again.

320
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,882
How dare you.

321
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:16,792
Hey, what's going on?

322
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,383
I don't know. Looks like they're
camping out for something.

323
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:19,883
Yeah, but for what?

324
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:21,912
It was me.

325
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:24,012
I started this.

326
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,742
If I hadn't picked
up that penny,

327
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:28,520
we wouldn't have gone to get hot
dogs all the way across town.

328
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:30,980
And we wouldn't have seen
that wedding dress store,

329
00:19:30,996 --> 00:19:32,941
Lily wouldn't have wanted
to camp out there,

330
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:36,161
and I wouldn't have needed a nap
at your apartment the next day.

331
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,422
Marshall wouldn't
have broken his toe.

332
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:40,582
Barney wouldn't have
run the marathon.

333
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,603
I wouldn't have jumped
that turnstile,

334
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:45,122
gotten arrested,
had that court date...

335
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:47,300
And we would have
made our flight.

336
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:49,881
I don't think we can go
back any further than that

337
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,032
unless you know who
dropped the penny.

338
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:53,060
I wish I did.

339
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:55,163
Though that person's already
been punished enough,

340
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:57,663
losing a sweet penny like that.

341
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:02,251
Oh,  please tell me you
have some good news.

342
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:04,063
Uh, I'm afraid not.

343
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:07,430
There are no extra seats on the plane.
I'm sorry.

344
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:09,502
All, right, well,
thanks for trying.

345
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:13,811
I can't believe this.
That's it, it's over.

346
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:15,632
Ted, come on.

347
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:19,023
Your destiny just wasn't to
make it to Chicago today.

348
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:21,970
Anyway, if that firm really wants you,
they'll reschedule.

349
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:25,652
<i>But that's not what happened.
They didn't reschedule.</i>

350
00:20:25,668 --> 00:20:27,532
<i>They hired someone else.</i>

351
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:30,081
<i>And as it turned out,
three months later,</i>

352
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:33,372
<i>that guy ended up having
to relocate to Chicago.</i>

353
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:35,761
Kids, funny thing
about destiny--

354
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,241
I thought I was destined
to get that job.

355
00:20:38,258 --> 00:20:39,772
But I was wrong.

356
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:42,151
My destiny was to
stay in New York.

357
00:20:42,486 --> 00:20:44,410
Because if I hadn't,

358
00:20:44,428 --> 00:20:46,570
I never would have
met your mother.
