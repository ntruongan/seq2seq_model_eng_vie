1
00:00:00,735 --> 00:00:04,529
Kids, as you know, Christmas is a
time you spend with your family.

2
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:07,355
So in December of 2006,
I had three options.

3
00:00:07,365 --> 00:00:10,186
Spend it with my mom and
her new boyfriend Clint,

4
00:00:10,196 --> 00:00:13,755
spend it with my dad and his
new girlfriend micro-brewing,

5
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:15,964
or head down to Staten
Island to spend it

6
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,164
with my super religious
cousin Stacy and her family.

7
00:00:19,274 --> 00:00:21,302
So I opted for
none of the above

8
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:25,223
and decided to spend
Christmas 2006 in Manhattan...

9
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:28,442
celebrating with
my other family.

10
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:34,120
Okay, I have one last paper
due at 5:00 p.m. today,

11
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:36,581
so until then,
I will be at the law library at school,

12
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:38,273
but I'm not to be
disturbed for any reason.

13
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,262
Dude, open your eyes.
You're going to hurt yourself.

14
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:43,353
No, no. Christmas Eve winter
wonderland is my reward

15
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:44,963
for finishing my paper.

16
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,411
Baby, do I smell your
Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?

17
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:49,543
Yes.

18
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:52,003
Damn me and my
heightened other senses.

19
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:53,371
Must be strong.

20
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,713
Okay, I'll be back
here at 5:00.

21
00:00:55,728 --> 00:00:58,900
Save me at least 20 cookies
and do not clean the bowl.

22
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:03,093
Was that a reindeer?

23
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:04,340
I don't want to know!

24
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:11,811
Hey, look.
Our old answering machine.

25
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:14,351
Oh, yeah. After you left,
we, uh, we unplugged it

26
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:17,663
because it reminded Marshall of how
you used to, you know, leave messages.

27
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,103
But hey,
you guys are back together.

28
00:01:20,117 --> 00:01:22,751
I say we're plugging
it back in.

29
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:25,923
It's good to have you back.

30
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:27,141
Thanks.

31
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:30,123
Oh, hey, look,
there's still some messages on here.

32
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:32,741
Hey Ted,
it's Dad calling to check in.

33
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:35,112
I'm going fishing this
weekend with my friend Clint,

34
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:38,690
so if I don't hear from you beforehand,
I'll talk to you next week.

35
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:40,452
Yes, same Clint.

36
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:44,650
Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the
couch right now moping about Lily?

37
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:46,160
You are, aren't you?

38
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:48,470
Well, stop it.
She's not worth it.

39
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:50,440
You gotta get over that Grinch.

40
00:01:50,997 --> 00:01:52,950
But I didn't say "Grinch."

41
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:54,772
I said a bad word.

42
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:57,262
A very, very bad word.

43
00:01:58,427 --> 00:02:00,801
Oh, fudge.

44
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:02,770
But I didn't say fudge.

45
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:23,250
I'm... a what?

46
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:25,903
I-- That was Barney,
that was Barney.

47
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,700
- That was you, Ted.
- That was Marshall.

48
00:02:27,718 --> 00:02:29,831
Marshall left a
message for Marshall?

49
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:34,642
You know, it may have been me,
but it was so long ago.

50
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:38,081
Man, that machine,
it really garbles your voice.

51
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:39,413
You know, it almost
made it sound like I said...

52
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:41,330
Why would you call me that?

53
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:43,043
It was a fair question.

54
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:45,870
Marshall's breakup with Lily had
sent him into a deep depression

55
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:47,502
and nothing could
get him out of it.

56
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:49,370
Until one day...

57
00:02:49,596 --> 00:02:51,231
She was perfect.

58
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:54,152
I lost the perfect woman.

59
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:57,352
I should have knocked her
up when I had the chance.

60
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:59,131
Okay. That's it.

61
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:02,723
You're never going to get over her until
you stop putting her on a pedestal.

62
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:06,693
So no more ice cream until you tell
me one thing that's wrong with Lily.

63
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,761
There's only one of her?

64
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:11,060
Okay.

65
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:12,451
She called off your wedding

66
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:15,072
and dumped you to be a
painter in San Francisco.

67
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:16,480
What do you call that?

68
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:18,741
Fiercely independent?

69
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:20,892
Brave?

70
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:25,373
I guess it was a
little selfish.

71
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:27,062
There you go.

72
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:31,781
And in almost no time,
that spark turned into a roaring fire.

73
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:34,320
Yeah. No, you're right.
Lily would laugh at anything.

74
00:03:34,336 --> 00:03:36,023
She'd give it up for a bad pun.

75
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:38,050
I'm telling you,
she's a laugh slut.

76
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,922
Remember that time we
heard her laughing

77
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:41,653
and we thought she was
watching Weekend At Bernie's,

78
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,710
but it turned out she was
watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?

79
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,411
And  her art?

80
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,412
"I'm Lily, I'm an artist."

81
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:50,132
She doesn't even own a beret.

82
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,670
Yeah, and if she's
such a great "artist,"

83
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:54,710
why does she suck
at Pictionary?

84
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:57,840
Who draws a ninja star like a
Star of David? Right, right?

85
00:03:57,855 --> 00:03:58,901
Yeah!

86
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:01,090
- Another round!
- Yeah!

87
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:03,663
I was trying to help him.
I'm his best friend.

88
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,523
That's the best friend's job.

89
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:08,911
The best friend's job is
to call me that word?

90
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:10,471
Yeah.

91
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:12,722
Oh, Ted.

92
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:14,383
Oh, Teddy boy.

93
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:17,181
Why is this such a big deal?
It's just a word.

94
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:19,212
We use lots of words,
every day.

95
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:21,323
It shouldn't be any different
than any other word.

96
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:23,112
Then why don't you say it now?

97
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:24,703
Grinch.

98
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:28,493
You timed that didn't you?

99
00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:29,860
Perfectly.

100
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:31,951
Well, at least you apologized.

101
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:34,552
You apologized, didn't you?

102
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:35,663
Oh, yeah.

103
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:38,191
"I'm sorry" were the first
words out of my mouth.

104
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:40,831
I'm sorry,
but I am not apologizing.

105
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,940
I was just trying to put
the guy back together.

106
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:44,210
You smashed him to pieces.

107
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:47,102
Are you seriously not going to
apologize for leaving that message?

108
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:48,123
- No!
- Why not?

109
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:50,610
Because, Lily, this summer,
you were kind of a Grinch.

110
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,141
- Oooh.
- Oooh.

111
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:56,010
Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby.

112
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:59,062
Ted Vivian Mosby!

113
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:00,342
That's not my middle name.

114
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:02,015
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

115
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:04,073
Like you've never
said that word.

116
00:05:04,157 --> 00:05:06,183
I don't kiss your
mother with my mouth.

117
00:05:06,196 --> 00:05:07,351
Yet.

118
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:10,130
Are you sick?

119
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:13,203
Is it sick to find maturity
and experience sexy?

120
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:14,900
No, I meant do you have a cold?

121
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,210
I'm fine.

122
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:24,250
I'm fine. My nose
is just overflowing with awesome

123
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:25,901
and I had to get
some of it out.

124
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,101
Now, if you'll excuse me,
the holidays are a time

125
00:05:29,116 --> 00:05:31,300
when people are
lonely and desperate.

126
00:05:31,316 --> 00:05:34,161
It's the most wonderful
time of the year.

127
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:38,971
I  should go apologize.
It's Christmas Eve.

128
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:43,223
Yeah. I mean,
slamming doors and screaming curses?

129
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:45,790
If I wanted that, I would
have gone home for the holidays.

130
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:51,560
I don't see any
mistletoe, but...

131
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:55,631
Oh!  Oh, God!

132
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:59,431
Uh... "Bless you"
would have been nice.

133
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:02,431
- You're sick.
- I'm not sick.

134
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:04,041
- You're sick.
- You know what? I am sick.

135
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:06,903
Sick of you telling me I'm sick.
What up?

136
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:17,531
Ahh... Three flights of stairs,
not a drop spilled.

137
00:06:17,547 --> 00:06:18,783
Hey, buddy.

138
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:21,541
You sure this is gonna work?

139
00:06:21,556 --> 00:06:22,660
Yeah, this is our thing.

140
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:25,090
In college, whenever I wanted to make
up with her, I'd buy her a beer.

141
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:26,780
- Cute, right?
- Totally.

142
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:28,001
Plus free mug.

143
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:30,840
Okay, come on.

144
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:33,311
Usually that would've
done the trick,

145
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:37,163
but it turned out this was a problem
not even alcohol could solve.

146
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,692
Actually the beer
helped a little.

147
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,043
She took the decorations.

148
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:55,643
She took the decorations!

149
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:56,920
What a Grinch!

150
00:06:56,937 --> 00:06:58,942
That time I did say "Grinch."

151
00:06:58,957 --> 00:06:59,962
All right.

152
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:01,782
I guess I have to
call her, right?

153
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:04,982
Lily's cell phone.

154
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:07,150
She'll listen to
reason-- right?

155
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:10,080
Oh, hey, Billy.

156
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,143
Actually, funny thing--
the voice dial got you.

157
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:14,413
I was trying to call...

158
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:17,480
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

159
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:21,393
Yeah, the holidays are a rough
time for everyone, Billy.

160
00:07:22,327 --> 00:07:24,871
Okay, yeah,
dinner next Wednesday.

161
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:26,323
Okay.

162
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:28,581
Damn voice dial.

163
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:34,533
Barney! What the
hell are you doing?

164
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:37,680
Get in here, it's freezing outside.
Are you insane?

165
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:42,412
Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive
"no cigars in the apartment rule."

166
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:44,823
God, it's like Marshall's
marrying the Taliban.

167
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:46,632
High five.

168
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:48,100
Eww. No.

169
00:07:48,115 --> 00:07:50,683
You have to go home
and get to bed.

170
00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:55,393
Oh, Robin, my simple friend
from the untamed north,

171
00:07:56,055 --> 00:08:00,812
let me tell you about a little
thing I like to call mind over body.

172
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:03,882
You see,
whenever I start feeling sick,

173
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:07,383
I just stop being sick
and be awesome instead.

174
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:08,931
True story.

175
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:11,850
Yeah, in two minutes,

176
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:16,303
I'm going to pound a sixer
of Red Bull, hop in a cab,

177
00:08:16,318 --> 00:08:18,620
play a couple of
hours of laser tag,

178
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:21,981
maybe get a spray-on tan.

179
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:25,082
It's gonna be legen...

180
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:26,932
Wait for it...

181
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:31,533
Lily!

182
00:08:31,548 --> 00:08:33,461
Merry Christmas, assface.

183
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:36,840
Um, Lily?
Where are the Christmas decorations?

184
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:38,603
At my apartment.

185
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,432
You want to bring them back so we can
celebrate Christmas together-- please?

186
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:44,351
Ted, do you know
what I would do

187
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:46,970
if one of my kindergartners
used that kind of language?

188
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:49,230
I would be on the phone
with their parents.

189
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:51,183
Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.

190
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,300
Exactly. You know
what that word means.

191
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:56,443
You know that calling people
names is mean and hurtful...

192
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:57,851
assface.

193
00:08:58,136 --> 00:09:01,442
Lily, if you don't bring that
stuff back right now, we...

194
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,401
She hung up.

195
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,391
She's just mad.
She'll cool down.

196
00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:08,690
Lily...

197
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,792
Don't forget to take the
cookies out of the oven...

198
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:11,963
assface!

199
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:13,970
Damn it!

200
00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:17,631
I could be in Cleveland right now
making peppermint lager with my dad.

201
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:19,112
Where are you going?

202
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:20,693
Marshall gets home
in three hours.

203
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:24,013
He's gonna show up--
no Lily, no winter wonderland.

204
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:25,932
I gotta get up to the Bronx.

205
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:29,062
...dary.

206
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,862
Hey, dude,
how's the paper going?

207
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:37,641
Screw the paper, how's the winter
wonderland? Is it magical?

208
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:39,382
Oh...  so magical.

209
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:40,812
When you walk through the door,
does it feel like

210
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:43,532
you've been slapped in
the face by Christmas?

211
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:45,392
Sure does. Look, I gotta go.

212
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:47,802
Come on, man, describe it!
Tell me about the decorations.

213
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:49,791
Is Rudolph there?
He is, isn't he?

214
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:51,541
Hi, Rudolph!

215
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:54,001
Ah, yeah, but, you know...

216
00:09:54,016 --> 00:09:56,422
decorations, is that really
what Christmas is about?

217
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:58,103
Hell, yeah!
What else would it be about?

218
00:09:58,116 --> 00:10:00,622
Uh, try the birth of Christ.

219
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:04,101
You know, Christmas--
Christ Mas,

220
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:07,243
which means "More Christ"
to our Spanish friends.

221
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:09,882
Yeah, well,
all I know is walking in that door

222
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:13,990
and seeing the winter wonderland
and seeing Lily and all you guys,

223
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:15,971
just... I can't wait.

224
00:10:15,986 --> 00:10:17,890
Right. I gotta go.

225
00:10:17,906 --> 00:10:18,962
Right. Okay.

226
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:20,611
Oh, wait. Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted.
One more thing.

227
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:22,893
How about the cookies?
Are they delicious?

228
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:29,582
You know, honestly,
they taste a little store-bought.

229
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,841
Oh! I got another call.

230
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,582
Well, tell Lily I love her.

231
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:34,553
Right.

232
00:10:34,998 --> 00:10:37,971
- Hello?
- Ted Evelyn Mosby!

233
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:40,323
Oh. Uh, hey, Mom.
Merry Christmas.

234
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:43,662
I just got the most
disturbing call from Lily.

235
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:46,940
How could you use
such a horrible word?

236
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:48,583
Oh, God, she called you?

237
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:50,643
Are you acting out
because of the divorce?

238
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:52,493
Is-is this all about Clint?

239
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:54,531
No, Mom,
why would it be about Clint?

240
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:58,030
Hey, buddy, it's Clint.
How you doing, champ?

241
00:10:58,105 --> 00:11:01,523
Hey, Clint. Listen, um,
I don't really have time to...

242
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,013
Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted.

243
00:11:03,026 --> 00:11:04,202
You don't know this yet,

244
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:06,903
but you and I are going
to be great friends.

245
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,740
Now, the Native Americans
have this ritual...

246
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:20,921
This is a low moment
for the Barnacle.

247
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:24,663
I should be off playing
laser tag right now,

248
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:26,193
but instead...

249
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,292
Don't look at me. I'm hideous.

250
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,592
You just look like
a regular guy.

251
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,712
Exactly.

252
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,710
I'm a Ted.
I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants.

253
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:38,770
And isn't it more comfy?

254
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,133
Yes.

255
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:42,993
Come on,
you need eat something.

256
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:47,970
Too weak... to hold... bowl.

257
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:51,202
Fine, I'll feed you.

258
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,772
Ouchie in my mouth!

259
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:05,350
I don't want it.
I want ice cream.

260
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:08,220
No, you're not having ice cream
for dinner just 'cause you're sick.

261
00:12:08,237 --> 00:12:09,933
- But my throat hurts.
- No.

262
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:11,423
I hate you!

263
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,862
Don't leave me.

264
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:22,070
Who is it?

265
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:23,592
Pizza delivery.

266
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:28,851
Whoa.

267
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:30,770
Hey, you tricked me.

268
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:32,833
You really thought I was
the pizza delivery guy?

269
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:35,080
No, I knew it was you.

270
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:37,521
I just thought you'd at
least bring a pizza.

271
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:38,931
Yeah, well,

272
00:12:39,747 --> 00:12:42,443
I brought a beer,
but I gave it to a homeless guy.

273
00:12:43,186 --> 00:12:45,333
All  right, he took it from me.

274
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,413
Now, will you please come home?

275
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:50,400
No, I'm not spending
Christmas with you.

276
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,172
Okay, I'm sorry for
calling you a...

277
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,070
that word,

278
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:56,622
over the summer,

279
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:58,602
and for saying it again today.

280
00:12:58,837 --> 00:13:01,481
And for thinking it a lot
on the subway ride over.

281
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:05,562
I had no right to say that. It was
hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.

282
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:07,150
Oh, shut up.

283
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:11,263
You think I don't know your fake
apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh?

284
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:13,672
You're clearly still mad at me.

285
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:15,532
- I'm not mad at you.
- Yes, you are.

286
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:17,662
I am not mad at you, Lily.
Now, can we please just...

287
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:20,083
I've apologized to Marshall
and he's forgiven me

288
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:22,130
and we've moved passed it.
Why can't you?

289
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:24,971
Because you never
apologized to me.

290
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,451
Marshall's not the only
one you walked out on.

291
00:13:27,485 --> 00:13:29,983
You leave for three months,
you don't even call.

292
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:32,160
Come on, Lily,
we're supposed to be friends!

293
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,120
Yeah, some friend,
you called me a Grinch.

294
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:36,420
- You were a Grinch!
- How can you...

295
00:13:36,438 --> 00:13:41,110
Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch,
Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.

296
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:43,630
Happy?

297
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:46,020
Now, you've pissed off
the big guy upstairs.

298
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:48,220
Yeah, I'm sure
God cares if I...

299
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:51,432
You use that language again
and I'll turn off your water!

300
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:53,870
That's my super.
He lives above me.

301
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,843
Great. Thanks to
your filthy mouth,

302
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:58,391
now I'm going to have
Christmas alone in the dark.

303
00:13:58,408 --> 00:14:01,142
Fine. I don't want
to ruin Christmas.

304
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:03,122
You can have the apartment.
Don't worry about seeing me there

305
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:05,100
I'll be in Staten Island
with my cousin Stacy.

306
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:06,153
Just....

307
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:11,072
Ow.

308
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:15,732
Merry Christmas.

309
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:19,053
You're spending Christmas
Eve with your family?

310
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:21,671
Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.

311
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:24,410
Uh, they're fine. They're just...
they're a little weird.

312
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:26,850
You know they don't believe
in gifts or Christmas trees.

313
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,161
And they think Santa's
how Satan spells his name

314
00:14:29,176 --> 00:14:31,062
when he wants to trick us.

315
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:33,110
Well, do you want
me to go with you?

316
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:34,423
Was that a sincere offer?

317
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:36,243
First tell me your answer.

318
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:37,970
Stay there. Save yourself.

319
00:14:37,988 --> 00:14:39,421
We'll spend all day
together tomorrow.

320
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:40,272
Okay.

321
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:41,511
Oh, how's Barney feeling?

322
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:44,361
You mean the whiney
bottomless pit of neediness?

323
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:48,211
He was bugging me, so I spiked
his echinacea tea with codeine.

324
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:52,162
You're gonna be a great mom.

325
00:14:56,265 --> 00:15:01,203
Holy crap, the magical
Christmas season is upon us.

326
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:04,350
And thank God we don't
pay for utilities.

327
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:05,823
Merry Christmas!

328
00:15:05,835 --> 00:15:07,451
What's in the box?

329
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:11,752
Only the best present
for the best girl ever.

330
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,322
It took me all day
to track it down.

331
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:15,012
I thought you were
writing a paper.

332
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:17,013
Ah, naw, I blew that off.
I'll get an extension.

333
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:18,200
School's not important.

334
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:21,840
What is that pitter
patter on the roof?

335
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:25,552
Could it be the sound of
an awesome Christmas story

336
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:27,703
about to come down the chimney?

337
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:30,120
Why, yes, it is.

338
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:32,492
'Twas the day
before Christmas...

339
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:34,562
It was supposed to arrive,
like, five days ago,

340
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:36,411
but then it got
lost and rerouted.

341
00:15:36,428 --> 00:15:38,840
I checked two other branches,
finally they told me it was here.

342
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:41,650
Yeah, all I needed to know
was the tracking number.

343
00:15:42,797 --> 00:15:46,213
Looks like it's headed out to our
regional branch in Poughkeepsie.

344
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:47,260
What?

345
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:49,841
No, no, no, no,
I need that package today.

346
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:52,201
Listen, the truck already
left five minutes ago,

347
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,823
so unless you want
to run after it...

348
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:58,343
Stop! Stop!

349
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:00,783
Stop, please, stop.

350
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:03,231
Stop. Stop the truck.

351
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:10,273
I need a package on your truck.
Can I please take a look in back?

352
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:12,583
Sure. But I gotta keep
driving my route.

353
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:14,053
I'm running behind.

354
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:21,382
My bad.

355
00:16:21,405 --> 00:16:22,761
I'm okay.

356
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:29,043
Hey, man, thanks for helping me
make my fiancée's Christmas.

357
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,220
No problem.

358
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:33,533
Too bad I can't deliver all these
packages by the end of the day.

359
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:37,821
Wait, so some people aren't going to
get their gifts in time for Christmas?

360
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:40,330
Sadly, no.

361
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:54,083
# They call me back door Santa #

362
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:58,322
# I make my runs #
# about the break of day #

363
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:03,621
# They call me back door Santa #

364
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:07,931
# I make my runs #
# about the break of day #

365
00:17:07,946 --> 00:17:09,532
# Oh, ho, ho #

366
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,900
# I make all #
# the little girls happy... #

367
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,923
We delivered every single
package on that truck.

368
00:17:15,937 --> 00:17:18,471
But I still have one
package left to give.

369
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:20,143
Yeah, I did.

370
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:22,931
Merry Christmas.

371
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:25,233
- Open it, Baby.
- Okay.

372
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:28,783
Oh, my God.

373
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:31,331
An Easy Bake Oven!

374
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:34,333
I've wanted one of these ever
since I was a little girl.

375
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:36,542
In this exact model.

376
00:17:36,998 --> 00:17:40,020
I never told you that.
How did you know?

377
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:42,890
It's our first Christmas
since we got back together.

378
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:44,571
I want to get her
something really special.

379
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,363
So I'm getting her a jukebox.

380
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,460
Wow, that's a great gift.

381
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:51,201
Not really.
It's this big and it dispenses gum.

382
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:55,513
Oh, man, I know
something you could get her

383
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:58,033
that would blow her mind.

384
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:00,130
Ready?

385
00:18:00,148 --> 00:18:01,853
Eight years ago...

386
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:08,021
When I was a kid,
all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven.

387
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:09,641
I begged and I begged,

388
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:13,601
but all I got was a stupid Lego set
because my feminist mom

389
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:17,632
didn't want me conforming to
traditional gender roles.

390
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:21,641
Easy Bake Oven--
that's what I'm going to call my van.

391
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:28,880
Dude... how was the concert?

392
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:32,740
I  couldn't find the outside.

393
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:40,683
I can't believe Ted remembered
after all these years.

394
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:43,052
Yeah, and after all that weed.

395
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:45,443
Where is he anyway?

396
00:18:45,897 --> 00:18:47,683
Staten Island.

397
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:49,651
Why?

398
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:57,163
Okay, don't tell your mom,
but I got you guys some presents.

399
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,480
Like the gift
of God's love?

400
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:01,490
No, dude, real presents.

401
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,212
Uncle Ted got us presents!

402
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:09,171
That's okay, Ted,
we'll just give them to charity.

403
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:10,190
Yay!

404
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:12,001
Uh, not you, Charity.

405
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,291
I meant the less fortunate.

406
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:18,190
Ted, how would you like
to say grace tonight?

407
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:20,321
Uh, you know what,
why don't you say it.

408
00:19:20,336 --> 00:19:21,932
I really wouldn't
know what to say.

409
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:25,112
Why don't you recite your
favorite passage of scripture.

410
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,581
That's a great idea, Charity.

411
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:28,892
But, really, I don't know.

412
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:31,162
I mean how do you choose
your favorite passage?

413
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:35,320
It's the Bible; there's so many...
great ones...

414
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:37,742
That one from Pulp
Fiction's pretty cool.

415
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:40,332
Ooh, I'll get it.
Charity, I'm tapping you in.

416
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:42,982
Dear, Father,
thank you for this day,

417
00:19:42,997 --> 00:19:45,692
and thank you for bringing
this family together.

418
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:47,030
Amen.

419
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,592
Who is it, Ted?

420
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:52,863
Uh, it's...
it's just, um, carolers.

421
00:19:55,926 --> 00:20:00,123
# Silent night #

422
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:04,211
# Holy night... #

423
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,971
I came here to apologize.

424
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:09,150
I'm so sorry, Ted.

425
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,030
I accept. Give me the beer.

426
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:17,622
Oh, oh,
it is so good to see you guys.

427
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:19,290
Are you coming home?

428
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,990
Totally.

429
00:20:22,015 --> 00:20:23,901
But first, Lily,
I owe you an apology.

430
00:20:23,915 --> 00:20:26,963
Oh, for the love of God,
are you as sick of apologies as I am?

431
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:27,753
Yes!

432
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,640
Can we just skip the apology and
go straight to the forgiving?

433
00:20:30,658 --> 00:20:31,833
Yes.

434
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:36,082
And I promise, I will never ever
call you a... you know, again.

435
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:37,223
That's okay.

436
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,050
I was kind of a Grinch.

437
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:41,032
What's a Grinch?

438
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:45,332
Nothing. It's something
you shouldn't say.

439
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:47,921
Mom, what's a Grinch?

440
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,691
Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...

441
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:56,331
Merry Christmas, everybody.

442
00:20:57,646 --> 00:20:59,252
Run, run.

443
00:21:17,765 --> 00:21:19,740
Merry Christmas, Marshall.
