1
00:00:01,148 --> 00:00:03,369
Some kids dream of
being astronauts.

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,558
Some kids dream of
playing baseball.

3
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:08,099
When I was a kid,
I had only one dream.

4
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:09,688
To build a skyscraper.

5
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:11,664
That's stupid.

6
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:15,206
There were some
obstacles along the way.

7
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,605
But eventually my
dream came true.

8
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:20,226
I became an architect.

9
00:00:20,236 --> 00:00:21,604
Morning, everyone!

10
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:26,480
So, I had an idea
for the atrium.

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,905
Ready?

12
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:29,966
Columns.

13
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:32,330
That's stupid.

14
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:56,080
I... I can't believe you
knocked over my model.

15
00:00:56,095 --> 00:01:00,143
Well, it's just...
it's not exactly new, is it-- columns?

16
00:01:00,156 --> 00:01:03,380
I mean, what's your next
groundbreaking idea-- ceilings?

17
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:04,963
Floors?

18
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:06,760
Windows?

19
00:01:06,807 --> 00:01:09,531
I know what you're thinking:
Who's this jerk?

20
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:12,081
Well, this jerk was
Hammond Druthers,

21
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:14,411
a legend in the
architecture community.

22
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:16,271
Very big in the '80s.

23
00:01:16,906 --> 00:01:20,012
He was also far and away
the worst boss I ever had.

24
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:23,540
Then I designed the Spokane
National Bank Building.

25
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:26,011
And suddenly... I was his boss.

26
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:28,513
- And he didn't like it.
- Stairs?

27
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:31,813
And to be honest,
I wasn't sure I liked it either.

28
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:34,802
See, before,
when I was just another employee,

29
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:37,342
I was happy, carefree.

30
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:40,183
The guy who hung out in the break
room making fun of the boss.

31
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:41,253
Did you see what he
was wearing today?

32
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:44,040
It was like his pants were
being held up by his nipples.

33
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:49,681
Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers,
I get hay fever just looking at it.

34
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:54,232
But suddenly I was
a different guy.

35
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:56,841
Hey, guys.

36
00:01:57,336 --> 00:01:58,781
What's so funny?

37
00:01:58,887 --> 00:01:59,983
Nothing.

38
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:02,961
Um... nice shirt.

39
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:04,673
Thanks.

40
00:02:04,687 --> 00:02:06,382
The hours were insane.

41
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:09,560
I was always working even
when I wasn't at work.

42
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:12,960
Oh, Robin...
I just had a great idea.

43
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:16,702
Oh, do whatever you want to
me just don't wake me up.

44
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:22,340
Before, I used to be this guy.

45
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:25,662
Dude, of course you should take the
day off for the Foo Fighters concert.

46
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:26,912
Just say you're sick.

47
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:28,040
But now...

48
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:29,392
I was this guy.

49
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:30,782
Sick, huh?

50
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,101
Unbutton your shirt.

51
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:38,642
Hmm... "Foo Fighters."

52
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:41,603
Get back to work.

53
00:02:42,016 --> 00:02:45,001
But still,
the worst part was Druthers.

54
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:47,223
- Well, I was thinking...
- Ceilings? Oops.

55
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:51,973
Said that already. Then again,
you seem to like rehashing old ideas.

56
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:54,670
I'm kidding, of course.

57
00:02:54,738 --> 00:02:56,633
Another hole in one, boss.

58
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,203
Oh, wow,
he must be really good-looking.

59
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:01,293
Why would you say that?

60
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,262
Well, 'cause only good-looking people
can get away with saying things like that.

61
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:05,713
I have found that to be true.

62
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:07,681
It's a blessing
and a curse really.

63
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:10,570
Ted, you can't let him
treat you like that.

64
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:12,833
Yeah, you gotta ask yourself,
who's the boss?

65
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:14,850
- Tony.
- Angela.   - Mona.

66
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:16,112
Mona?

67
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:18,632
Watch it more closely.
Rock your world.

68
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,663
So, what are you gonna do?

69
00:03:20,676 --> 00:03:23,983
Well... it's awkward, I mean,
the guy used to be my boss.

70
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:26,143
So, I went to talk to
the managing partner.

71
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:27,500
Fire him.

72
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,971
Well, sir, I was thinking he could
just be put on a different project.

73
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:32,281
Fire him!

74
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:35,962
He's an arrogant,
washed-up, pain in the ass.

75
00:03:35,977 --> 00:03:38,791
In fact,
fire everyone on that project.

76
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:42,040
Druthers, Mosby,
the whole lot of them.

77
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,441
Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear
Mosby's doing some great work.

78
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:50,180
Fine, Mosby can stay.
But tell him he's on thin ice.

79
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:53,553
Come here.

80
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:58,073
I like you, Crosby.

81
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:01,053
You mind if I charge my phone?

82
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:02,373
Knock yourself out.

83
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:05,971
Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers,
the key is timing.

84
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:08,391
Remember when I had to
fire my makeup artist?

85
00:04:08,427 --> 00:04:12,323
Vicki, um...
I'm so sorry about this,

86
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:15,522
but there's been some
budget cuts and, um,

87
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:17,361
we have to let you go.

88
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:19,582
I mean, after tonight.

89
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:22,222
I still need my makeup
for the broadcast.

90
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:24,192
So...

91
00:04:25,936 --> 00:04:29,872
Our thoughts and prayers go out
to the families of the victims.

92
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,240
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

93
00:04:31,258 --> 00:04:33,202
I'm gonna fire
Druthers tomorrow.

94
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:38,981
- Oh, my God!
- What?

95
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:41,243
- Do you know about this?
- No.

96
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:42,332
What is that?

97
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:44,922
Only the greatest thing ever.

98
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:47,632
Wait, wait, wait--
that's not enough buildup.

99
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:50,522
If they were to cure
cancer tomorrow,

100
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:53,191
this would still be the greatest
thing to happen all week.

101
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:57,520
Okay. Now you're ready
for naked Marshall.

102
00:04:58,148 --> 00:04:59,813
Oh, my God.

103
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:02,442
This  is awesome times awesome.

104
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:04,023
It's awesome squared.

105
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:06,551
I know, right?
Behind the piano this whole time.

106
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:08,932
Wait. If Marshall went to
all this trouble to hide it,

107
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:11,013
he clearly doesn't
want us to find it.

108
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:12,562
Oh, come on, Robin.

109
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:16,412
No, I'm saying that he must be
really embarrassed by this.

110
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:19,171
We are gonna have so much fun.

111
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,092
I know!
We're gonna have so much fun!

112
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:23,511
Oh, sorry I'm late;
lunch ran a little long.

113
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:24,942
You wanted to see me, Mosby?

114
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,370
Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.

115
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:30,943
Well, excuse me,
for spending the last four hours

116
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,540
drawing designs
for your building.

117
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:36,163
This is a cocktail napkin.

118
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,600
Covered in profanity.

119
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:41,861
Look, Hammond, um,

120
00:05:41,877 --> 00:05:44,643
there's no easy way
to say this, so...

121
00:05:45,197 --> 00:05:48,400
why don't we just, um,
step into your office.

122
00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:53,800
# Happy birthday to you #

123
00:05:53,818 --> 00:05:57,683
- # Happy birthday to you #
- Oh, you had me. You so had me.

124
00:05:57,697 --> 00:06:01,870
# Happy birthday, dear Hammond #

125
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:05,190
# Happy birthday to you #

126
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:07,520
So, you didn't fire him?

127
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:10,671
I can't fire a guy on his birthday.
Everyone would hate me.

128
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:14,352
Besides, they put a party hat on me.
My authority was compromised.

129
00:06:15,465 --> 00:06:18,382
Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat.

130
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:21,820
I know how much
you love stools.

131
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:25,142
Thanks. Yeah,
stools are better for your posture.

132
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:29,783
And, uh... I... got you a rose.

133
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:31,890
Thank you. That's so sweet.

134
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:34,830
You guys are being... so sweet.

135
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:38,170
Hey, guys. Guess what I got.
A new dart.

136
00:06:38,187 --> 00:06:39,910
Oh, wow, a new dart.

137
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:41,690
Hey, that new dart is great.

138
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:44,012
I did not know you were such
a fan of new dart, Barney.

139
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:46,733
Oh, yes, Robin,
I just love new dart.

140
00:06:46,747 --> 00:06:48,560
Nude art.

141
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,530
- Nude art.
- Nude art.

142
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,795
Okay, all right, so what,
you guys found the painting, huh?

143
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:56,216
I knew this day would come.

144
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:57,450
How did you know that?

145
00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:59,453
Because I didn't
hide it very well.

146
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:02,321
So the story on the painting is that,
back in college,

147
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:05,243
Lily wanted to do a nude
study for her art class.

148
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:07,121
Marshall wasn't
so into the idea.

149
00:07:07,138 --> 00:07:09,172
Well, I just...
don't think that some dude

150
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:11,853
should drop trou just
to pose for you.

151
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:16,271
It's for class, and it's just that
weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.

152
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:18,062
The frisbee dude
with the soul patch?

153
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:19,753
He's like the hottest
guy in school!

154
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:21,101
No, he's actually
a little husky...

155
00:07:21,138 --> 00:07:22,743
Oh, he's just huggable!

156
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,350
And complicated...

157
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:26,220
and a little bit of a jerk.

158
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,901
Just enough so you think
maybe you can change him.

159
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:31,031
Okay, just forget it.

160
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,103
Call me old-fashioned,

161
00:07:35,117 --> 00:07:38,890
I just think that I'm the only
guy you should see naked.

162
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,541
Well, then you'll
have to do it.

163
00:07:41,558 --> 00:07:44,803
Are you kidding me?
What if somebody sees it?

164
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:47,162
We're not in high
school anymore.

165
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:50,842
People don't make fun of you
for posing nude for a painting.

166
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:52,612
We're adults now.

167
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,631
We totally saw your butt.

168
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:00,803
This painting has caused
too much grief already.

169
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:02,512
I'm destroying it right now.

170
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:05,600
Oh, no,
what's the matter, Marshall?

171
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,732
Where is it?

172
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:10,193
I'll tell you where it is if
you'll answer these riddles three.

173
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:11,972
You hung it up in the bar,
didn't you?

174
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:13,702
Yo, why you gotta
ruin my riddles?

175
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,803
Field trip!

176
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:24,622
Oh, no. Someone put your
painting up behind the bar.

177
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:25,803
Classic!

178
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:27,762
What a memorable prank.

179
00:08:29,418 --> 00:08:31,370
Hey, Marshall.
What'll you have?

180
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:34,362
What'll I have?
Um, I don't know, maybe a beer

181
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,410
and that nude painting of
me hanging behind the bar!

182
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:39,311
Ooh,  I'm sorry,
that painting's property of the bar.

183
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:40,772
I know that Barney gave
you that painting.

184
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:42,113
I don't know what
you're talking about.

185
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,573
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll pay you double.

186
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:44,573
I doubt it.

187
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:46,421
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll give you that plus ten bucks.

188
00:08:46,456 --> 00:08:47,340
I doubt it.

189
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:49,971
All right, you know what, Carl, you
just lost yourself a regular customer.

190
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:51,531
I doubt it.

191
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,962
This painting is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

192
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:03,322
Okay, where should we put it up next?
In his law school?

193
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:04,993
Ooh on the side of a bus.
Oh, oh!

194
00:09:05,006 --> 00:09:06,542
How much do billboards cost?

195
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:09,070
Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse.

196
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:11,431
I've got a five-year
rollout plan.

197
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:14,042
I'll have you know that painting's
got commitments all over the city.

198
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:15,682
Then, after New York...

199
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:25,222
One of my worst
fears has come true--

200
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:27,463
I just saw Marshall
grabbing himself naked.

201
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:29,841
Well, I gotta go.

202
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,833
Believe it or not,
I have to go back to the office.

203
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:33,292
Oh, I'll go out with you.

204
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:34,402
Bye, guys.

205
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,872
You know, I wish everyone didn't
have to make fun of that painting.

206
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:41,431
Eh, we're not making fun of the painting,
we're just making fun of Marshall.

207
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,573
The painting's
actually really great.

208
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:45,782
-  Are you serious?
- Yeah.

209
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:47,742
Well, thank you.

210
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:51,151
You know, seeing it again
makes me miss painting nudes.

211
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:55,150
What?

212
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:57,050
Paint me.

213
00:09:57,756 --> 00:09:58,940
What?

214
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:01,851
Paint  me.

215
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:08,962
Who's that?

216
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,581
Who's out there?

217
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:12,563
Hammond, is that you?

218
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:13,902
Mosby?

219
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,382
Druthers and I were
alone in the office.

220
00:10:17,396 --> 00:10:18,740
If I was gonna fire him,

221
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:20,740
this would be the best
chance I'd ever have.

222
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:22,650
Uh, look, just a second, Ted.

223
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:24,761
Uh, no, I,
I really need to talk to you.

224
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:26,851
Look, there's no
easy way to say...

225
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:28,322
What, what are you doing?

226
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:30,660
What are you doing?

227
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:33,500
I'm standing here
wearing pants.

228
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:36,761
Are you sleeping here?
What's going on?

229
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:38,430
Okay, fine, yes.

230
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:39,773
Not that it's any
of your business

231
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:42,611
but my wife had a little
spat a few weeks ago,

232
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:45,563
and I've been sleeping
here until she cools off.

233
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:48,412
Okay, well, uh, you're right--
that is none of my business.

234
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:50,653
Uh, look,
there's no easy way to say this-- I...

235
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,042
Who am I kidding?

236
00:10:52,257 --> 00:10:55,202
She's never gonna take me back.

237
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:02,313
It's okay.

238
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:10,120
What did you want to say to me?

239
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:14,422
Happy birthday, buddy.

240
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:27,113
So, you've been
living at the office?

241
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:28,540
Yes.

242
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:31,670
I'm an architect
without a home.

243
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:34,290
You see the tragic
irony in that?

244
00:11:34,307 --> 00:11:35,991
- Yeah, I do.
- 'Cause I design homes.

245
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:37,243
- I see it.
- But I don't have a home.

246
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:38,632
Not lost on me at all.

247
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:42,282
But I don't understand--
why don't you just go to a hotel?

248
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:44,773
You could be sleeping on
a mattress instead of...

249
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:48,013
what appears to be torn-up
drawings of my building.

250
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:50,110
Why would I go to a hotel,
when any second,

251
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,562
she's going to call and
tell me to come home.

252
00:11:54,317 --> 00:11:56,813
She's a very special lady, Ted.

253
00:11:56,907 --> 00:12:01,150
She's quite... mannish.

254
00:12:01,248 --> 00:12:03,652
She gives me what I need.

255
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:05,431
Do you understand that?

256
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:08,221
Uh, no, I don't.

257
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,870
If you were lost
in the wilderness,

258
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:13,252
she can provide for me.

259
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:16,332
Well, that's the dream.

260
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:20,283
I'm glad you came
here tonight, Ted.

261
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:21,272
Me too, Hammond.

262
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:22,331
- Call me Ham.
- No, thanks.

263
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,853
- Hammy D?
- No, I think just Hammond.

264
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:28,450
So, I'm guessing
you didn't fire him.

265
00:12:30,728 --> 00:12:33,071
I was this close.

266
00:12:33,808 --> 00:12:36,120
Meanwhile, Lily had
been up all night

267
00:12:36,136 --> 00:12:38,143
in the grips of a dilemma.

268
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:50,720
- Oh honey, you're awake?
- I'm awake.

269
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:53,682
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

270
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:56,612
I've kind of been
wrestling with something.

271
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:59,802
What if I told you I had a
way to pay for our honeymoon?

272
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:01,652
Baby, our honeymoon's
already paid for.

273
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,503
We're going to Howe Caverns.

274
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:08,770
Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't
want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?

275
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:12,471
It's not just a cave,
it's a whole labyrinth of caves.

276
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:14,391
It's an underground adventure.

277
00:13:14,405 --> 00:13:17,522
There's a cave that's so dark that
you don't even know you're in there.

278
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:20,550
I mean, we're going to experience
a whole new kind of dark.

279
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:24,642
Well, what if I found a way
to make a little extra money

280
00:13:24,657 --> 00:13:27,783
so that we spend our
honeymoon not in Howe Caverns,

281
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:30,223
but in Scotland?

282
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:32,291
- Loch Ness?
- Yeah.

283
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:35,331
And you know, Edinburgh and
the Highlands and Glasgow...

284
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:38,230
Loch Ness. Nessy.

285
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:42,771
Baby, I would love to search for the
enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch,

286
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:45,722
but... we can't afford that.

287
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:47,672
Maybe we can.

288
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:50,893
Paint me.

289
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:53,091
Okay, I don't get this.

290
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:55,140
You've been making fun of
that painting all this time

291
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:56,782
and now you want
me to paint you?

292
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:59,451
We knew we could torture
Marshall because he has shame.

293
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:00,622
I do not.

294
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:03,390
In my body,
where the shame gland should be,

295
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:05,813
there's a second awesome gland.

296
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:07,172
True story.

297
00:14:07,336 --> 00:14:10,163
Yeah, that's not the gland
I'm worried about painting.

298
00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:11,792
Yeah.

299
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:14,551
A nude Barney is a challenge.

300
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:18,860
But I think you're talented
enough to immortalize this.

301
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,710
Now is the time-- I'm 31.

302
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:24,601
I'm at the peak of
my physical beauty.

303
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:28,862
If I were a woman,
I'd have passed it long, long ago.

304
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:31,120
Long ago.

305
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:32,493
Forget it.

306
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,990
I promised Marshall he was the
only guy I would ever see naked.

307
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:40,872
I'll give you $5,000.

308
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,412
We're going to Loch Ness!

309
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:43,581
Yeah!

310
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:48,333
That cabby would not shut up.

311
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,311
Yeah, we should
call him a gabby.

312
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:52,651
I think it, you say it.

313
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,002
Hey, uh... thanks for putting
me up last night, buddy.

314
00:14:57,308 --> 00:14:58,673
Give 'em hell.

315
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:02,302
Morning, team.

316
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:05,032
So, I have given
it some thought,

317
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:09,142
and I say we revisit columns.

318
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,793
Oh, God, not this again.

319
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:15,510
Ted, a man in a toga just arrived
and delivered a parchment.

320
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:16,950
Let me read it:

321
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:19,253
Oh! It's from ancient Greece.

322
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:22,591
They want their basic
architectural elements back.

323
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:24,633
- Geez.
- What?

324
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:25,970
You didn't hear me?

325
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:27,832
Toga, parchment...

326
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:29,903
Can I see you for one second?

327
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:32,592
Ooh, I'm in trouble now.

328
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,031
What are you doing?

329
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:38,590
I thought we were friends.

330
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:40,680
You slept on my couch,
you ate my cereal.

331
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:43,070
I tossed you more toilet paper.

332
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:44,352
We are friends.

333
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:48,412
But that doesn't magically
make your bad ideas good.

334
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:50,211
What? I don't believe this!

335
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:52,323
You're, you're,
you're wearing my clothes!

336
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:54,373
And my
girlfriend's... sneakers--

337
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:56,583
man, you have
weirdly small feet.

338
00:15:56,637 --> 00:16:00,423
Ted, I hope that you're not going
to let our professional woes

339
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:02,401
interfere with our friendship,

340
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:05,722
because I really kind
of need you right now.

341
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:10,152
Okay, let's get this over with.

342
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:13,100
Hey, hey!
I don't want you phoning this in.

343
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:16,133
This painting could, someday,
become a serious work of art.

344
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:18,793
I mean, you have been
blessed with an amazing gift.

345
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:20,200
Thank you.

346
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:21,782
I meant me.

347
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:25,673
Now, I like how you captured
Marshall's essence.

348
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:28,011
Goofy and unburdened, with wit.

349
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:30,712
But me,
I want something more regal.

350
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:32,891
Something my progeny
could look at and say,

351
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:35,653
"There's stands
Barnabus Stinson."

352
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,373
He was wise...

353
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:39,560
and strong.

354
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:43,943
I don't think your
sword will fit.

355
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:45,642
I get that a lot.

356
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,950
And so, as Lily began painting,

357
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,883
Marshall thought
about the $5,000

358
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:53,380
and what his fiancée
was doing to earn it.

359
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:55,090
This isn't right.

360
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:58,043
This isn't right at all.

361
00:16:58,056 --> 00:17:00,560
Finally, he could
take it no more.

362
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:05,081
Hold still.

363
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:08,441
Hold still.

364
00:17:10,718 --> 00:17:13,680
- Hold still!
- Paint faster!

365
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:18,643
Okay, I guess it's time.

366
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:21,113
Drop your shorts.

367
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:22,871
Yeah.

368
00:17:23,837 --> 00:17:25,120
Wait, wait!

369
00:17:25,137 --> 00:17:27,783
That wasn't enough buildup.
I need...

370
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:31,012
In a world without justice,
one man--

371
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:33,191
- Oh, just drop them!
- All right.

372
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:38,770
- No! No, this is not right!
- We had a deal!

373
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:40,700
Well, I'm going back on the deal.
Barney, get out!

374
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:42,452
- You...!
- It's over!

375
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:48,630
Lily, I can't let you
go through with this!

376
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:52,093
I found a castle we can stay in,
but it's an extra two grand.

377
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,901
It's just not right!

378
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,570
It's beautiful and
they say it's haunted.

379
00:17:56,587 --> 00:18:00,290
I can't let the woman I love
compromise her values for money!

380
00:18:00,306 --> 00:18:03,260
I totally think we can get
some more money out of him.

381
00:18:03,277 --> 00:18:05,950
I'm never letting my
fiancée, ever...!

382
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,470
Oh, you're still here?

383
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:08,693
Before you say anything,

384
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,233
I'll give you an
extra five grand.

385
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:11,520
We accept.

386
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:15,410
You people are so
easy to control.

387
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:18,680
Dance for me, puppets, dance.

388
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:22,670
And  that's how Uncle Barney paid
for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.

389
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:26,271
Come on, Ted, listen,
why don't we get back

390
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:28,022
and finish drawing the
plans for a building

391
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:30,402
which, in my opinion,
is never going to get built,

392
00:18:30,418 --> 00:18:33,151
so you and I can get out of here
and grab a couple of beers.

393
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,152
No.

394
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:37,610
Look, Hammond,
there's no easy way to say this but...

395
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,743
Looking for Hammond Druthers.

396
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:40,592
Oh, that's me.
I'm Hammond Druthers.

397
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:44,341
These are divorce papers.

398
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,952
You've been served.

399
00:18:45,976 --> 00:18:47,590
Oh, God.

400
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:50,483
She's really going
through with this.

401
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:53,743
So that's it. It's over.

402
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:56,110
There is no easy way
to say this, but...

403
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:59,293
She's giving me the
remains of Wolfie?

404
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,731
My dog is dead?

405
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,453
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.

406
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:07,713
She always played
too rough with him.

407
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:11,371
Believe me,
there is no easy way to say this--

408
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:15,710
- # Happy birthday to you... #
- You've got to be kidding me!

409
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:18,553
Guys, you have no idea how much
this means to me right now.

410
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:20,120
Wait, his birthday
was yesterday!

411
00:19:20,138 --> 00:19:22,372
Yeah, but a bunch of us were up
at the conference in Montreal,

412
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:25,603
- so we thought...
- No! No birthday! No!

413
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:28,211
I got something to say
and I'm gonna get it out.

414
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:31,242
Hammond, listen to me.
I am sorry that your dog died,

415
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:33,773
and that your wife is
divorcing you and that...

416
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:36,260
your life is falling apart and that
these guys missed your birthday.

417
00:19:36,295 --> 00:19:38,161
And there is no
easy way to say...

418
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,932
What are you doing?
What's going on?

419
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,433
Oh, God...

420
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:44,262
Oh, come on, you're not going
to pull that, are you?

421
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:49,293
Oh! Look, yeah, right.
Now we're falling onto the ground.

422
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:52,372
Well, nice try, but guess what?

423
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:54,181
You're fired!

424
00:19:54,196 --> 00:19:57,362
You're fired--
you get it? You hear me?

425
00:19:57,378 --> 00:20:00,133
You're gone! You're fired!

426
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:19,423
In my defense,
I think we all suspected Hammond

427
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:21,191
might have been faking.

428
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:26,750
On the plus side, the EMTs seem to
think he's going to be just fine

429
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:31,232
and, as you saw, they did admit that
I did not cause the heart attack,

430
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:33,791
even if they said it
a bit begrudgingly.

431
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,892
And there it was, rock bottom:

432
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:39,700
They all hated me.

433
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:41,781
But just when all seemed lost,

434
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:45,030
I had the greatest idea
of my entire career.

435
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:51,731
Margarita Fridays--
great idea, boss.

436
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:05,673
Okay, it's done.

437
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:09,032
I'm gonna step out,
so you can admire it.

438
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:10,841
Thank you very much, Lily.

439
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:15,852
Marshall, do you
have the money?

440
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:17,921
- Yeah.
- Let's get out of here!

441
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:21,400
A smooth area?!
You gave me the Ken doll?!

442
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:27,530
She left out Little Barney.

443
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:30,503
Barnacle Junior.

444
00:21:31,086 --> 00:21:33,491
My Barnana is...

445
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:37,323
Barnito Supreme.
