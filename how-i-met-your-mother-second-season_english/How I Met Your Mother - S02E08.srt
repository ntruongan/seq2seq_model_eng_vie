1
00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:02,921
And so, after six months apart,

2
00:00:02,932 --> 00:00:05,656
Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall
were finally back together.

3
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,092
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:07,596 --> 00:00:09,599
These pancakes are delicious!

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,912
Yes. Thank you.

6
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:12,954
Um, I learned how to cook while
you were gone this summer.

7
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:15,748
Oh. Do you want to
cook dinner tonight?

8
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:17,963
Yeah, sure.

9
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:20,092
How about pancakes?

10
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:23,350
And things were back
to normal... almost.

11
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:25,863
You may not have much range,
but at least I'm marrying a guy

12
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:28,080
who knows how to make pancakes.

13
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,075
Oh, um...

14
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:34,663
I mean, um...

15
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:39,193
Well, I... I realize that we
haven't really discussed

16
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:43,430
whether us getting back together
means us getting married, but...

17
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:45,633
I still wanna.

18
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,450
Do you still wanna?

19
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:49,213
Really?

20
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,203
Of course, I love you.

21
00:00:52,216 --> 00:00:54,510
No, I mean,
that's how you're gonna do it?

22
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:58,650
"Do you still wanna?" That's
like the lamest proposal ever.

23
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:02,761
When I did it, I got down on my knees...
I don't know, I'm just saying.

24
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:09,160
Marshall Eriksen,
will you ma...

25
00:01:09,176 --> 00:01:11,343
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What?!

26
00:01:11,365 --> 00:01:14,003
You can't lead with that.
You got to... build up to that.

27
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:16,702
You got to have,
like, a little speech.

28
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:19,551
Do you remember your
proposal to me?

29
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:22,561
I had a speech prepared.

30
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:24,573
What do you want to hear?

31
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:27,061
I don't know.
I mean, you could tell me,

32
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:31,852
like, about how good-looking
and funny and smart I am

33
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:33,381
and I've been
working out lately.

34
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:37,681
It might be nice for you to
mention something... about that.

35
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:40,212
Marshall...

36
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:43,113
- you are good-looking...
- Thank you.

37
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:44,561
- You're funny.
- Oh, thanks.

38
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:46,373
- You're smart.
- And a few tears wouldn't hurt.

39
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,200
Okay, would you freakin'
marry me already?

40
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:50,423
I'll marry you. Of course.

41
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:54,893
But, um, until you see a ring on this
finger, don't expect me to put out.

42
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,851
Yeah, right.

45
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,152
I'll give you this.

46
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:22,121
That was a very
creative use of syrup.

47
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:26,610
I can't even look Mrs.
Butterworth in the eye.

48
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:32,153
Oh, my God.
We're getting married!

49
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:33,881
I know, I know.

50
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:36,410
It was a moment of happiness,

51
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:39,291
followed of course by a
moment of total panic.

52
00:02:39,308 --> 00:02:41,411
See, when they called
off their first wedding,

53
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,720
Aunt Lily took off
for San Francisco

54
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:46,091
leaving Uncle Marshall
with the unfortunate task

55
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:47,862
of telling his entire family.

56
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:50,843
Yeah, so now she's gone
and the wedding's off.

57
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:53,230
What do you call someone who just
takes off and leaves like that?

58
00:02:53,268 --> 00:02:54,723
What do you call that?

59
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:58,432
I think that that's
a little strong.

60
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:01,580
I can't even believe you
would use a word like that.

61
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,501
Geez, Grandma.

62
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,913
Man, I made a big mess by
canceling this wedding, didn't I?

63
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:10,870
It's okay, baby.

64
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:14,133
You're not just realizing that now,
are you?

65
00:03:15,548 --> 00:03:19,262
God, the idea of standing up
there in front of all those people

66
00:03:19,277 --> 00:03:21,163
who hate my guts...

67
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:25,430
just makes me want to run off to
Atlantic City and get married today.

68
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:26,952
Yeah.

69
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:33,401
Coming up at 11:00:
Are there piranhas in the East River?

70
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:37,251
What you don't know...
could eat you.

71
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:39,510
Robin! Stop the news!

72
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:41,643
- What the hell? 
- It's okay. They're my friends.

73
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:44,501
We're going to Atlantic City to elope.
You got to come with us.

74
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,491
Oh, my God,
that is so fantastic!

75
00:03:46,508 --> 00:03:48,390
I-I don't know if I
can just leave work.

76
00:03:48,406 --> 00:03:51,021
It's okay;
Mike can read the news tonight.

77
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:54,123
Hey,  Mike...
you can read, right?

78
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:56,533
Yeah, I'm the best at reading.

79
00:03:57,216 --> 00:03:59,690
- Let's go to Atlantic City!
- Yeah!

80
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:04,860
You guys are eloping!
Oh, that's fantastic.

81
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,630
Wait, is this because there's a time
crunch Uncle Ted should know about?

82
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:10,540
I hope not because I plan
on getting hammered.

83
00:04:10,757 --> 00:04:13,860
Guys, this sounds like so much fun,
but I can't really take off work.

84
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,593
I'm kind of important around here,
you know? I'm the project manager.

85
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:18,601
Ted, for the rest of our lives,

86
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:20,792
we are going to be
telling the amazing story

87
00:04:20,806 --> 00:04:23,471
of how we went to Atlantic
City and got married.

88
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:25,990
Don't you want to
be in that story?

89
00:04:26,106 --> 00:04:27,480
Of course I do.

90
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:29,293
- Let's go to Atlantic City!
- Yeah!

91
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:32,582
Oh, but when we tell the story, can you
leave out the part where I hesitate?

92
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:34,070
You got it.

93
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:37,900
Hey, guys.

94
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:40,632
Wow. A pedicure.

95
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:43,461
Uh, if there were any shame
in a dude getting a pedicure

96
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:47,641
I don't think there would have been a
feature about it in Details magazine.

97
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:51,391
We're going to Atlantic
City to elope right now!

98
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:53,802
Oh, congratulations, Lily.

99
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:56,762
Marshall, you're getting married?
What the hell?

100
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:58,733
So are you in or not?

101
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:00,180
Hell, yeah, I'm in!

102
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:01,713
Just... I'm almost done.

103
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:04,530
- No, we got to get going to the...
- Well, actually, I mean...

104
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:07,682
It is my wedding day,
and since we're here...

105
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:12,250
So we all got a pedicure
and then headed down...

106
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:14,562
to Atlantic City.

107
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:24,293
Wow. Look at this place.

108
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:26,560
I guess I'll have my
pick of something old.

109
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:29,942
And something blue. Somebody
should really check on this lady.

110
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:34,263
Ah, A.C., always in decline,

111
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,943
never hitting bottom.

112
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:38,201
It's good to be back,
old friend.

113
00:05:38,217 --> 00:05:39,650
You been here before?

114
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:41,313
Oh, uh, once or twice.

115
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:42,653
Barney!

116
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,501
Ah, good to see you, too.

117
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:47,690
Three times, maybe.

118
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:50,542
The wedding chapel--
this is it.

119
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,360
Are you ready to do this?

120
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:53,761
I'm  ready.

121
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:56,002
- Let's get married.
- Yeah.

122
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:58,440
Oh, crap. I don't have a veil.

123
00:05:58,455 --> 00:06:01,381
I'm a bride;
I can't get married without a veil.

124
00:06:01,398 --> 00:06:04,290
And a bouquet.
I need a veil and a bouquet.

125
00:06:04,307 --> 00:06:06,832
Oh, my God,
we're getting married.

126
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:09,123
Don't worry. Relax.
We'll get you a veil, honey.

127
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:11,481
Oh, Robin,
that's a really cute outfit.

128
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,732
Oh, really? Thanks.

129
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:15,572
Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride;
you can't look better than me.

130
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:16,822
Done.

131
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:19,812
I'm going to get the bouquet.
You guys get the veil.

132
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:21,881
We'll meet in the
chapel in 20 minutes.

133
00:06:21,897 --> 00:06:23,462
Ready,  break.

134
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:27,330
You guys want to go gamble?

135
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:28,782
No, we got to go get the veil.

136
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:31,033
Or we looked everywhere,
and we couldn't find one.

137
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:32,413
Yeah, okay.

138
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:35,442
No, you guys go ahead.
I'm going to find the veil.

139
00:06:37,516 --> 00:06:40,872
So this is it, right?
The last 20 minutes of your single life.

140
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:41,992
- I'm proud of you, buddy.
- Thanks.

141
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,690
- How are you feeling?
- Great, a little nervous.

142
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:45,531
- Yeah? Craps?
- Not that nervous.

143
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:48,020
- No, I mean do you want to play craps.
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

144
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:49,663
Okay, I got the veil.

145
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:51,120
She wasn't ready to be married.

146
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:52,695
All right,
let's talk bachelor party.

147
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:54,850
Are we thinking full-on strip club,
or should we rent a room

148
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:57,633
and have a private
toy show-- whew.

149
00:06:57,648 --> 00:06:59,081
What did you just say?

150
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:02,082
- Barney, no.
- Marshall, I'm your best man.

151
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:03,770
- You're not my best man.
- Right here.

152
00:07:03,786 --> 00:07:06,660
And as your best man,
I have to throw you a bachelor party.

153
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,262
That's part of
being a best friend.

154
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:09,330
- You're not my best friend.
- Right here.

155
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:11,643
Barney, I don't have any
time for a bachelor party.

156
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,931
I've got, like, 18 minutes.

157
00:07:14,698 --> 00:07:16,600
18 minutes.

158
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:20,583
Oh, good. Did you get the veil?

159
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:21,712
Of course.

160
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:24,853
And it took us
exactly 18 minutes.

161
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:26,002
We went to a strip club.

162
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:27,532
- Dude!
- Unbelievable!

163
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,241
We weren't there for very long.
It's not like I had time

164
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:32,300
to have a lap dance or anything.
I got a lap dance.

165
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,771
- Your last lap dance ever.
- Right...

166
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:35,753
What?

167
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:38,850
Okay, I'm here. Right?

168
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:42,920
Oh, God, the things people
waste money on in Atlantic City.

169
00:07:42,938 --> 00:07:44,663
Does it smell like
strippers in here?

170
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:46,033
That's weird, right?

171
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:48,273
Marshall and Lily
are getting married!

172
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,393
Hell, yeah, look at this.

173
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:55,942
Oh, baby, this is it.

174
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:58,160
- Let's do this thing.
- All right.

175
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:01,223
Hi. We're here to get married.

176
00:08:01,236 --> 00:08:04,423
Congratulations. We offer
a variety of packages

177
00:08:04,446 --> 00:08:07,931
to give you the special day
you've always dreamed about.

178
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:11,002
We don't want any of that. Just your
basic quickie wedding will be fine.

179
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,291
Yeah.

180
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:17,391
You know this
isn't Vegas, right?

181
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:20,222
Well, sure.
In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen.

182
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:22,523
Here, it looks like
everyone brought their own.

183
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,692
What?

184
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:29,311
It also takes three days to get
a marriage license in New Jersey.

185
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:31,373
The earliest I could
book you for is Monday.

186
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,833
No, no, no, it has to be today.
That's the whole point.

187
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:36,302
Look, I don't know what to say,

188
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,922
but if you guys don't want
to book a wedding for Monday

189
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:41,812
or play a round of keno,
I can't help you.

190
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,651
Thirty-five.

191
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:55,091
Wait, I don't understand, people get
married in Atlantic City all the time.

192
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:57,280
Yes, they do,
but they don't elope.

193
00:08:57,297 --> 00:09:00,231
They choose Atlantic City
for its white sand beaches,

194
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,602
world-class amenities,
and exotic Riviera feel.

195
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:05,181
Have you been outside?

196
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:08,741
There is half an orca whale rotting
not 20 feet from the cabana.

197
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:10,232
You guys, take it easy, guys.

198
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:11,620
Are you sure about this?

199
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:15,491
About the marriage laws of the state
where I work in a wedding chapel?

200
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:17,343
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

201
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:20,861
Bright side:
the bachelor party continues!

202
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:21,722
Yes!

203
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:24,381
Continues? You mean
"start." He means "start."

204
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:26,231
We went to a strip club.

205
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:28,832
Twenty-seven.

206
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:33,412
Is there any way that we
could get a license today?

207
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:35,000
You could go to the courthouse.

208
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:38,790
In some extreme circumstances,
the waiting period can be waived,

209
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:40,672
but you have to
have a good reason.

210
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:42,040
Well, we're in love.

211
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:43,941
What better reason
could there be?

212
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:45,030
The last one I heard was,

213
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:47,892
"I'm going to Iraq tomorrow
to defend my country,"

214
00:09:47,907 --> 00:09:50,961
but, you know,
give yours a whirl.

215
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:54,710
So we went to the courthouse.

216
00:09:55,557 --> 00:09:58,052
God, this is taking forever.

217
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:00,632
Can't believe they're
getting married.

218
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:01,542
I know.

219
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:04,453
I am so proud of these two.
After all they've been through.

220
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:07,393
In fact,
that crazy road has led them

221
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:09,842
all the way here
to Atlantic City.

222
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:11,441
Ted, up here.

223
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:14,832
You were just staring
at my shirt boobs.

224
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:16,330
No! I wasn't.

225
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:19,600
I-I was checking out the hot
bod underneath the shirt.

226
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:22,883
Okay, look,
maybe I was looking at your shirt,

227
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:26,981
but it's a, it's a funny,
funny shirt.

228
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:29,123
Hey, it's Barney!

229
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:31,002
- Barney!
- Hi.

230
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:36,120
...suit up.

231
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:45,903
...legend.

232
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:48,852
...Daddy.

233
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:50,541
American daddy.

234
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:57,651
What the hell was that?

235
00:10:57,665 --> 00:11:00,213
A... Chinese guy?

236
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:04,083
Hi. Hello.
Uh, we need a marriage license,

237
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:07,070
but we need to skip the
waiting period because...

238
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:08,221
we're in love.

239
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:12,091
Aw. I'm gonna waive this
waiting period right now.

240
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:13,160
Oh, really?!

241
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:15,471
Is what I would say if I could
waive the waiting period,

242
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:18,550
but unfortunately,
only a judge can do that.

243
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:21,242
Oh. Well,
so can we see a judge?

244
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:23,170
- Absolutely.
- Really?!

245
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:26,202
Is what I would say if there was any
chance of you seeing a judge today,

246
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,543
which there isn't.

247
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,701
Why are you doing this to us?!

248
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:34,131
'Cause you're on Candid Camera!

249
00:11:34,146 --> 00:11:36,023
- Really?!
- Is what I would say...

250
00:11:36,035 --> 00:11:37,842
You know what? We get it.

251
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:43,262
Okay, this is a good plan B.

252
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:45,452
Judges are people.
People go to the batoom.

253
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:47,512
A judge is bound to
come by eventually,

254
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:48,872
and we'll get married.

255
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:51,110
I'm  sure we won't
be waiting long.

256
00:11:57,435 --> 00:12:00,971
Geez, you go to a vending
machine for 30 seconds.

257
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:02,292
Vultures.

258
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,852
What?

259
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:13,553
Here?

260
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:15,991
Yeah. Got a little
time to kill.

261
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,851
Oh, my God,
it's the T-shirt, isn't it?

262
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:20,932
No.

263
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:22,242
A little.

264
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:24,802
Something is seriously
wrong with you.

265
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:26,871
So what, is that a no?

266
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:29,711
- All right, let's do it.
- All right.

267
00:12:29,726 --> 00:12:31,532
Um, also...?

268
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:33,432
- Yes, I'll leave it on.
- Sweet.

269
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,352
Guys, let's bail.
This is never gonna happen.

270
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:39,431
Look, I know this is turning
into a bit of a disaster,

271
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:42,652
but believe me,
it's better than the alternative.

272
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,712
You throwing a big,
free party with lots of booze and food

273
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:48,283
and all your single,
desperate girlfriends from college?

274
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:51,211
Yeah, glad we
dodged that bullet.

275
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:54,672
Judge! Judge, come on.
Come on, come on, come on!

276
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:03,993
- Turn it off.
- Okay.

277
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:08,423
May we please get
married today?

278
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:11,482
Now, normally I would say
no to a request like that,

279
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:13,593
but you two impress me.

280
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:16,733
Just  the fact that you've
been together for ten years,

281
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:20,312
standing by each other's
side through thick and thin,

282
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:22,623
never wavering.

283
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:26,051
- What was that?
- What was what?

284
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:28,041
That little look.
What was that?

285
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:30,791
A look of love.

286
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:34,911
You two have stood together
through thick and thin, right?

287
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:37,601
- You know, what's thick, what's thin?
- Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.

288
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:38,792
I have.

289
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:41,250
All right, what was that look?

290
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:43,630
What's going on?

291
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:45,400
They broke up over the summer.

292
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:49,061
Lily totally ran off to San Francisco
and these two just had sex in the closet.

293
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:52,321
What? We're under oath.

294
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:53,710
No, we're not.

295
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:57,361
Yeah, we are. He's a judge.

296
00:13:57,515 --> 00:13:58,980
Wh-- did we take an oath?

297
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:00,941
Do you even know
what an oath is?

298
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:04,033
Uh, yeah. Courthouse.

299
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:06,223
Oath. We're under it.

300
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:13,942
Guys. It's looking like
this isn't gonna happen.

301
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,503
No, Marshall,
we are gonna get married today.

302
00:14:16,517 --> 00:14:19,673
Baby, anyplace we go,
we're gonna need a marriage license.

303
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:22,300
Except international waters.

304
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:24,671
So-so let's find
a ship captain.

305
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:26,453
A ship captain can marry us.

306
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,580
There's boats all
over this place.

307
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:31,472
Oh, is that what those wooden things
are floating between the garbage?

308
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:35,651
This is a great idea.
This is gonna work. Let's go.

309
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:39,280
Excuse me.
Are you a ship captain?

310
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:41,413
This is my machine.

311
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:45,843
- I should go talk to her.
- No, let me.

312
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,200
- Blackjack?
- Yeah.

313
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,691
Well, I found a guy who said he'd be
willing to put his boat in my slip,

314
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,543
so we're getting closer.

315
00:14:58,557 --> 00:15:02,620
Okay, Lil, why is it 
so important to do this today?

316
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:05,770
Because... if we
don't do it today,

317
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:08,510
I just know we're gonna wind
up having a huge wedding

318
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:12,083
with a huge crowd full of
huge Midwestern people

319
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:14,233
looking all disapproving
and judging me

320
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,201
while sipping little
cups of mayonnaise

321
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,141
and-and cracking runaway
bride jokes all night long.

322
00:15:19,156 --> 00:15:20,841
- Nobody's gonna do that.
- No, they're not

323
00:15:20,857 --> 00:15:22,542
because I'm not gonna
give them the chance.

324
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:25,582
I'm gonna find a ship captain and
we're gonna be married tonight.

325
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:27,271
Sweetie, this is crazy.

326
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:28,583
You're never gonna
find a ship capt...

327
00:15:28,616 --> 00:15:30,810
Hey, Lily.
Found a ship captain.

328
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:32,323
- What?
- Yeah.

329
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:34,731
First guy we talked to.
Ship captain.

330
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,200
How great is that?

331
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:39,080
See? See, this is destiny.

332
00:15:39,098 --> 00:15:42,883
So, captain, can you take us out to
international waters and marry us?

333
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:43,921
I sure can.

334
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:47,612
If there's two things I love, it's
bringing people together in marriage

335
00:15:47,635 --> 00:15:49,860
- and making $5,000.
- What?

336
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:53,233
Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that.
Come on, everybody.

337
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:56,142
Fork over your cash.
Don't think. Just do it.

338
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,611
I can get us that money.

339
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:58,731
How?

340
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:00,443
Have you noticed
that all day today

341
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:03,362
Chinese guys have been coming
up and saying hi to me?

342
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,672
Yes. Have you noticed I
haven't asked about it

343
00:16:05,685 --> 00:16:07,683
because I'm too
scared of the answer?

344
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:10,113
Well, those are my
old gambling buddies.

345
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:12,700
Truth  is...
I used to come here all the time.

346
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:16,550
Play an old Chinese game
called "Shing Hasabu Shing".

347
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:18,652
Had a small gambling problem.

348
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:20,680
Actually, it wasn't
so small. I...

349
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:23,831
kind of lost my entire
life's savings.

350
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:26,482
But tonight, I don't know,
I'm feeling hot.

351
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:28,883
I think I can win
us that money.

352
00:16:28,908 --> 00:16:31,830
No, we're not letting you
gamble all our money away.

353
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:35,890
Uh, it's not gambling if you
absolutely know you're going to win.

354
00:16:36,015 --> 00:16:37,943
I'll get us that money.

355
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,972
I swear it, nay...

356
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:43,193
I oath it.

357
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:46,671
Now, I had been to a lot of
casinos before that night,

358
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:49,103
and I've been to a
lot of casinos since,

359
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:52,810
but in all that time I've never
seen a game quite like this one.

360
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:55,423
To this day,
I have no idea how it was played.

361
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:57,502
But luckily, Barney did.

362
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:00,443
Do you understand
what's happening?

363
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:02,221
Not a clue.

364
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:23,730
Do you think he's winning?

365
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:25,753
I don't even know
if he's playing.

366
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,221
Wait, I get it.
I understand this game.

367
00:17:34,237 --> 00:17:34,962
No, you don't.

368
00:17:34,978 --> 00:17:37,281
I totally understand
the game, Theodore.

369
00:17:37,298 --> 00:17:40,702
Barney, split your tiles. You can triple
your money if you find the jellybean.

370
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:43,890
Marshall, please.
Don't you think I know what I'm...

371
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:47,322
My God, you're right.

372
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:29,100
Wow. It's beautiful.

373
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:30,520
Thanks, Barney.

374
00:18:30,536 --> 00:18:32,172
Did you guys see me?
I was on fire tonight.

375
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:33,610
Man, I can't wait to
get back to the shore.

376
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,412
God, I love gambling!

377
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:38,352
When we get home, we're gonna
go to a little meeting. Okay?

378
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,463
Why can't I do it
just a little?

379
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:43,882
Okay.

380
00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:46,721
Let's get this started.

381
00:18:48,185 --> 00:18:50,160
Okay, uh...

382
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:52,890
you guys want the serious
one or the funny one?

383
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:56,120
Oh, I think...
serious would be best.

384
00:18:56,146 --> 00:18:59,943
You sure? I got a lot of
great nautical jokes in there.

385
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:03,151
Like how you two float each
other's boat, stuff like that.

386
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,231
Yeah, serious is probably good.

387
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:12,331
"We stand witness today

388
00:19:12,348 --> 00:19:16,982
"to celebrate the union
of Lily and Marshall.

389
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:19,690
"Today, you two
will become one,

390
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:21,752
"sharing your lives,

391
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:24,003
"the happiness, the sadness,

392
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:26,312
"the frustrations
and the joy..."

393
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:28,173
This is pretty cool.

394
00:19:28,187 --> 00:19:30,603
I can't believe you never
want to get married.

395
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:32,791
I never said "never."

396
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:34,803
"...to declare your love

397
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:36,531
"and devotion to each other

398
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:39,843
"in front of
friends and family,

399
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:42,932
"all the people who
matter most to you."

400
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:44,653
What was that?

401
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:46,493
What was what?

402
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:50,333
That little look.
You two just shared a look.

403
00:19:54,418 --> 00:19:57,130
- We don't want to do this.
- We don't.

404
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:59,220
Are you kidding me?

405
00:19:59,237 --> 00:20:01,601
You guys are calling
off another wedding?

406
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,242
After I spent all this
money on a bridesmaid shirt?

407
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:08,443
Did I bet someone that they'd call it
off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?

408
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:11,711
You actually expect any of us are
gonna come to your third wedding?

409
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:13,001
Yes.

410
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:15,520
'Cause it's gonna be amazing.

411
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,371
Look, before I was afraid
to face Marshall's family

412
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,341
and-and I didn't want to
do all that work, but...

413
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,301
now that we're here...

414
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:27,500
I realize that I have to
face Marshall's family

415
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:30,820
and I really want to
do all that work.

416
00:20:30,836 --> 00:20:32,201
So do I.

417
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:36,122
And yeah... my family 
might still be upset with you.

418
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:38,740
But when they see us up there, they're
gonna see how much we love each other

419
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:41,550
and none of that other
stuff is gonna matter.

420
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:44,592
- I love you, Marshall.
- I love you, too, Lily pad.

421
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:46,662
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

422
00:20:46,688 --> 00:20:47,940
- What?!
- What?!

423
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:49,623
What, is that not right?

424
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:52,151
Are... we married?
Did you just marry us?

425
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:54,230
Weren't you listening?
We don't want to be married.

426
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:57,951
Uh... I-I suppose I
could unpronounce you.

427
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,763
- Unpronounce us.
- Unpronounce us!

428
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:03,153
All right,
I unpronounce you man and wife.

429
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,521
Oh, whew... that was close.

430
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:08,473
And that's the story of how
Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily

431
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:10,600
got married for 12 seconds

432
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:12,951
somewhere off the
coast of Atlantic City.

433
00:21:17,597 --> 00:21:19,232
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

434
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:21,380
Ted.

435
00:21:30,006 --> 00:21:31,522
Is Robin here?

436
00:21:31,535 --> 00:21:33,242
Man, I hope so.
