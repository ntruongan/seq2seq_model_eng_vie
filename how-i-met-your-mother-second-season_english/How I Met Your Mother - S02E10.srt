1
00:01:49,084 --> 00:01:50,948
Kids, there's nothing
more wonderful

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,318
than New York City
in the winter...

3
00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:06,507
except the view of New
York City in the winter

4
00:00:06,517 --> 00:00:08,379
through your apartment window.

5
00:00:08,421 --> 00:00:11,307
In the winter of 2006,
Marshall, Lily, Robin and I

6
00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:13,901
were all deep in couple
hibernation mode.

7
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:16,604
Sadly, this left Uncle
Barney out in the cold.

8
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:18,792
Okay. All-night rave,

9
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:20,655
abandoned tire
factory in Newark.

10
00:00:20,668 --> 00:00:22,420
We're on the list. Who's in?

11
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:24,141
- Nope.
- No.

12
00:00:26,137 --> 00:00:30,103
Private jet. Teeterboro Airport,
skinny-skydiving. Who's in?

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,572
- Nope.
- No, thanks.

14
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:38,422
One beer. Bar, downstairs,
15 second walk. Who's in?

15
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:41,913
Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye.

16
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:46,892
It got so bad,
Barney tried to be his own wingman.

17
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:49,283
Hi. Have you met me?

18
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:53,930
Finally, he decided to
bring in reinforcements.

19
00:00:53,948 --> 00:00:55,373
- No.
- No.

20
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:58,133
Yes. And do you know why?

21
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:01,701
Hang on to your bedsores,
grandparents from Willy Wonka,

22
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:04,931
because guess who's on his way
up to this apartment right now?

23
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:07,761
My... wait for it...

24
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,382
brother, James. React.

25
00:01:10,397 --> 00:01:11,562
- Hey!
- Hey!

26
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:13,053
- You have a brother?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:17,273
He's the "awesome-est," most best
"looking-est," greatest guy ever.

28
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,220
He's exactly like Barney.

29
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:20,763
That's what I just said.

30
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:24,151
Well, Barney and his brother
aren't exactly alike.

31
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,650
James is gay.

32
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:27,582
Really? I never in
a million years

33
00:01:27,596 --> 00:01:30,233
would I picture you with a gay brother,
that's awesome.

34
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:31,973
Yeah. I just wanted
you to have a heads up,

35
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:34,433
so you don't act all
surprised when he gets here.

36
00:01:34,757 --> 00:01:36,132
Here he is.

37
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:40,072
What up, New York.

38
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:44,190
Thanks for the heads up.

39
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:04,302
How in God's name did it never come up
that Barney has a gay, black brother?

40
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:05,901
Is he black?

41
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:08,711
I guess I'm the kind of person that
focuses on who people are on the inside

42
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:11,070
rather than the
color of their skin.

43
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:14,060
I'm kidding,
I just wanted to see your face.

44
00:02:14,487 --> 00:02:16,362
Yeah, so now the
wedding's back on.

45
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:18,100
Anyway, James,
how have you been?

46
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:19,613
Awesome, as per "yoozh."

47
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:22,591
I just went
skinny-skydiving. Legendary.

48
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:25,402
And my laser tag team,
just made it to regional finals.

49
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:27,160
"Legendarier."

50
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:29,162
And by now you've
noticed the suit--

51
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:30,220
go 'head, touch it.

52
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:32,902
Handcrafted by
Pietro Dellacamera,

53
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:36,722
Milan's famous
101-year-old tailor

54
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:39,023
who upon completing
the very last stitch

55
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:41,043
in this suit dropped dead,

56
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:44,071
which is ironic because that
is how gorgeous I look in it.

57
00:02:44,087 --> 00:02:45,312
C'mon.

58
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:51,432
Gimme five.

59
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:53,050
Is "gimme five" back?

60
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:55,450
Oh, yeah.
I put it in my blog this morning.

61
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:58,000
Guys, "gimme five" is back!

62
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:00,121
Oh, James,
this is my girlfriend, Robin.

63
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:02,533
- Hey. It's so nice to meet you.
- You, too.

64
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:05,332
So, I have to ask,
there's a story here.

65
00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:07,123
Please.

66
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:10,160
The truth is,
Barney and James got a lot of...

67
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:12,561
different explanations from
their mom over the years.

68
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:14,730
Well, boys, you look different

69
00:03:14,748 --> 00:03:16,770
because when I was
pregnant with you,

70
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:19,001
I only ate vanilla ice cream.

71
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:20,980
And when I was
pregnant with you,

72
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:23,122
can you guess what kind
of ice cream I ate?

73
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,201
- Coffee?
- No, James,

74
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:27,531
I ate chocolate ice cream.

75
00:03:27,547 --> 00:03:31,331
But I did drink tons of coffee when
I was pregnant with both of you.

76
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:33,482
Can't smoke without my coffee.

77
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:38,280
I don't know, boys,
I guess it's just one of those things.

78
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:40,671
Stop asking me!

79
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:43,560
You  know what you two are?
You're little racists!

80
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:45,513
So what are you guys
gonna do tonight?

81
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:47,071
I'll tell you what
James is gonna do.

82
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:49,091
He's gonna do the job
you've been neglecting.

83
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:52,991
And, as always, he'll do it a
lot better than you ever did.

84
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:54,280
Ted...

85
00:03:54,297 --> 00:03:57,401
James is my wingman now.

86
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,332
Okay.

87
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:03,600
Last time James was in town,
Barney got slapped once,

88
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:05,281
lucky twice, and...

89
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:07,133
whose penthouse hot
tub did you end up in?

90
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:09,511
Ah, public figure,
confidentiality agreement.

91
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:10,832
But I will say this:

92
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:12,473
way more back hair than any guy

93
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:15,630
who can afford laser hair
removal should have.

94
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:19,773
And then there was the time they
scored the brother/sister combo.

95
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:21,372
It was everything
we ever dreamed of

96
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:23,203
when watching Donnie and Marie.

97
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:25,100
She was a little bit country.

98
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:27,880
He was a little bit
way into black guys.

99
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:31,351
Yeah, Barney and James together
was a lethal combination.

100
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:33,763
Since there was never
any crossover in targets,

101
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:35,180
James was always there for
Barney with the assist.

102
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,103
Whoa. Your scarf...

103
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:46,022
it is fierce!

104
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,611
Thanks. H & M.

105
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,133
What? I would never know,

106
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:53,503
'cause it is so hot that my eyes
are melting. Oh, I can't see.

107
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,083
Hey! You know,
speaking of things

108
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:57,883
that would look good
wrapped around you,

109
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,313
have you met my straight
brother, Barney?

110
00:05:00,326 --> 00:05:04,792
Oh, he is fab--
don't you go nowhere-- "ulous." Okay?

111
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:06,680
And Barney always
returned the favor.

112
00:05:06,698 --> 00:05:08,243
Help, I don't think
he's breathing.

113
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:09,973
Does anyone
know mouth-to-mouth?

114
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:11,973
Oh, my God, I do!

115
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:14,833
Okay, great.
How 'bout you instead?

116
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:17,881
Oh, man,
I am so excited that you're here!

117
00:05:17,895 --> 00:05:20,013
It has been forever since
I have been around anyone

118
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:21,670
even remotely fun.

119
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:23,623
Uh, yes offense.

120
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:26,360
You guys are still going
out with us tonight, right?

121
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,970
- No.
- Jammies.

122
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:30,341
Tonight? It's after 9:00 and...

123
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:32,371
I have warm soup belly.

124
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:35,371
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys...

125
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:38,163
you are young,
attractive people here

126
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:40,651
in the greatest city on earth.

127
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,121
There  are boys and girls

128
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:44,892
in Nobody Cares, Wyoming,
wishing they could be here.

129
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:48,183
But instead, they are in someone's
basement drinking bad malt liquor,

130
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:50,891
debating whether or not they're
going to spend their Saturday night

131
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:52,422
in  the parking lot
of the feed store

132
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,722
or in some other
dude's basement.

133
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:57,423
You owe it to them to rise up

134
00:05:57,506 --> 00:05:59,713
and shimmy your lazy
asses into something hot,

135
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:02,890
and you go out there and
you live their dream!

136
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:04,661
- Can I get a "hell, yeah"?
- Hell, yeah!

137
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,241
- Can I get a "hell, yeah"?
- Hell, yeah!

138
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:08,911
- Can I get a "woo-woo"?
- Woo-woo!

139
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:12,060
Go do it for Wyoming! Yes!

140
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:13,842
Testify!

141
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:17,033
So that night,
Barney got his wish.

142
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:18,181
We all went out.

143
00:06:18,197 --> 00:06:19,690
Daddy's home!

144
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,301
Yeah.

145
00:06:23,737 --> 00:06:25,663
All right, bro.
What do you like?

146
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,842
Guy in super tight black T?

147
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:29,531
Super tight black guy?

148
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:31,122
Guy who looks like Mr. T?

149
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:34,481
Mmm, yes, yes, and...
talk to me after two martinis.

150
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:36,542
Let's focus on you, my man.

151
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:38,633
I'm feeling lazy.

152
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,350
How 'bout girl with
the chocolatini?

153
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:43,292
Oh... boom, back tattoo.

154
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:45,010
Hero and the pig?

155
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:46,932
- Let's ride.
- Fo' 'sho.

156
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:52,131
Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!

157
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,800
- Get off me, you pig!
- Hey! Hey!

158
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:55,990
Her body art is not an
invitation to grope her,

159
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:58,090
it's an expression
of her inner self.

160
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:02,130
I'm sure, in many ways,
she is the dolphin encircled by flowers.

161
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:03,661
- What? What?
- What? What?

162
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:05,400
Cool.

163
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:09,312
Let me know if he
bothers you again.

164
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:12,852
Thanks. You should stay close...
just in case.

165
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,752
Sure. If it'll make
you feel safer.

166
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:17,261
I'm Barney.

167
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:20,731
Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy,
crowded bar,

168
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:23,613
you can always tell the
difference between the singles

169
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:25,192
and the couples.

170
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:27,573
You just have to
look for the signs.

171
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:29,380
- Break.
- Boiling hot.

172
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:31,651
Singles stay on their
feet for maneuverability.

173
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,112
- Hey!
- Hi, how are ya?

174
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,862
Have you met my brother?

175
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:38,800
Oh, hello. Have a drink.

176
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:40,491
Nice to meet ya.

177
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:45,981
Couples, exhausted by the
sheer act of leaving the house,

178
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:48,401
are obsessed with finding
a place to sit down.

179
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:51,591
There are a lot of
other indicators, too.

180
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:53,773
From choice of
social lubricant...

181
00:07:55,627 --> 00:07:57,592
...to basic body language.

182
00:07:58,157 --> 00:08:00,321
But the point is,
there are many ways to tell

183
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:02,451
whether someone
has Single Stamina

184
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:03,890
or Couples Coma.

185
00:08:03,905 --> 00:08:05,481
I wish I would've
worn sneakers.

186
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:08,333
I just got finished running
from some fat, hairy guy

187
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:10,803
who was periscoping out
of his pleather pants.

188
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:13,343
Permission to come
aboard denied.

189
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:15,313
I miss my jammies.

190
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:17,622
I can't believe I
wore a bra for this.

191
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:20,623
Bras suck.
They're so confining and unnatural.

192
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:22,822
Yeah, they're like
a boobie zoo.

193
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:25,380
Well, why don't you take it off
then and let those puppies breathe?

194
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,520
Oh, please go sweat
on someone else.

195
00:08:28,357 --> 00:08:29,713
Poor guy.

196
00:08:29,948 --> 00:08:32,063
Poor guy? Poor my boobs.

197
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:33,972
Well, it takes a lot of
guts to approach a girl

198
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,482
and you just crushed him.

199
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:38,841
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He looks all broken up inside.

200
00:08:39,057 --> 00:08:40,653
Whatever, you guys have
no idea what it's like

201
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,252
to be on the receiving end.

202
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:45,791
"Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl

203
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,770
and everybody everywhere
wants to buy me drinks

204
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:49,351
and have sex with me."

205
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:50,241
Waa.

206
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:53,130
"Oh, poor me.
I get to order yummy, pink drinks

207
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:55,181
with chunks of real fruit
that guys secretly like,

208
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:56,950
but  can't order because
they'll be made fun of."

209
00:08:56,988 --> 00:08:58,653
- Dude.
- They're delicious!

210
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:02,182
Excuse me. Join me in a shot?

211
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:04,101
Oh, no thanks. I've had enough.

212
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,013
He's too in shape,

213
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:12,081
we'd spend all night talking
about his body fat content.

214
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:13,931
Now, if you'll excuse me,

215
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:17,782
I'm gonna go have a yummy,
pink drink with fruit in it...

216
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:19,372
because I can.

217
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:22,951
You know, that was,
like, the third hot guy

218
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:24,662
that James blew off tonight.

219
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:27,090
Yeah, he's turning down shots,
he's yawning,

220
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:28,853
he's whining about his feet.

221
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,613
He's as bad as we are.

222
00:09:30,627 --> 00:09:31,802
He is.

223
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:35,460
Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are.
You guys don't think that James is...

224
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:36,842
in a relationship?

225
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:39,542
No. There's no way.
He's Barney's brother.

226
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:41,122
Look at that.

227
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:43,602
He's texting!

228
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:46,310
Oh, my God!

229
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:48,012
He is in a couple.

230
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:50,032
This is gonna kill Barney.

231
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:51,543
What's gonna kill me?

232
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:53,362
What's going on?

233
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,330
B-Barney?

234
00:09:56,105 --> 00:09:59,602
Have you noticed anything...
different about James?

235
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:00,672
No.

236
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:03,842
I mean, he's glowing from his peel,
if that's what you mean.

237
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:08,133
We have reason to believe
that James is, uh,

238
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,640
maybe hiding
something from you.

239
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:11,990
I-I know you're not gonna
like hearing this, but...

240
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,440
Barney...

241
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:15,652
your brother is...

242
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:18,273
monogamous.

243
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:21,560
That's ridiculous!

244
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:24,162
Just because he's
a little sleepy,

245
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:27,381
and he hasn't had sex with
anyone in a bathroom stall...

246
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:32,723
He hasn't had sex with
anyone in a bathroom stall.

247
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:35,051
And, Barney...

248
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:37,881
I hate to be the one to
tell you this, but...

249
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:40,332
he's texting.

250
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:42,680
No, he... No!

251
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,162
That... is impossible.

252
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:53,350
Excuse... Excuse... Ex...

253
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:55,772
Hey, bro.

254
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:57,471
Don't change the subject.

255
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:58,663
Let me see your phone.

256
00:10:58,676 --> 00:10:59,423
Why?

257
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:01,122
I just want to see your phone.
Let me see your phone.

258
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:03,310
No, it's just a phone.
It's just a phone!

259
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:05,542
And it's got Internet access,
and it's got a camera on it,

260
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:07,302
and you can surf the Web
and do the whole thing.

261
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:09,863
It's so amazing how far
technology has come.

262
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:10,942
What kind of phone do you have?

263
00:11:10,976 --> 00:11:12,130
I got...

264
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:18,261
Who is this?

265
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:21,623
And the answer better be:
"I don't remember his name."

266
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:24,901
That is Tom.

267
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,583
And he's my fiancé.

268
00:11:33,597 --> 00:11:34,662
Hey.

269
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:37,980
I don't support this.

270
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:39,131
Gay marriage?

271
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:41,812
Not gay marriage-- marriage!

272
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:44,423
How can you do this?

273
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,340
We  were raised in the same house,
with the same values!

274
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:50,791
Believe me,
I fought this for a long time.

275
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:52,853
Come on, it's embarrassing.

276
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:56,352
Look, this felt unnatural to me,
too, at first.

277
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:58,773
But I fell in love.

278
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:01,413
And Tom and I realized
you can't fight love.

279
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:02,630
Oh, God.

280
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:05,101
Is that what you two do together?
You sit around the house

281
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:08,823
and talk about love?
I think... I'm gonna be sick.

282
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:10,552
Okay, okay, look,

283
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:12,133
I need you to wrap your
head around this, okay?

284
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,190
Because it is happening.

285
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:17,191
And I want you to
be my best man.

286
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:19,982
What? No way.

287
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:26,613
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

288
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:32,913
I hope you change your mind.

289
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:40,291
Two beers, one shot.

290
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:42,800
Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.

291
00:12:46,945 --> 00:12:50,163
Oh, sweetie!
Did you make that for me?

292
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:52,993
Yes.

293
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:57,530
Clam Bake.
Staten Island. Who's in?

294
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:01,102
Okay, I didn't have high
hopes for that one.

295
00:13:01,307 --> 00:13:03,000
Okay, here's my thing.

296
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,663
If gay guys start
getting married,

297
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:06,983
then suddenly the whole
world's gonna be doing it.

298
00:13:06,998 --> 00:13:08,590
That's how it works.
They start something,

299
00:13:08,627 --> 00:13:11,302
then six months later,
everyone follows.

300
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:13,881
Like now everyone
gets manicures.

301
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:15,242
I don't get manicures.

302
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:18,383
Okay, then like how...
Like getting your chest waxed.

303
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:20,071
You get your chest waxed?

304
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:21,813
You know what I mean!

305
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:24,752
Gay marriage is going
to cause single life,

306
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:26,942
as we know it, to die out.

307
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,412
Think of how the American
family will be strengthened.

308
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:32,702
Barney, I'm sorry you're upset,
but you got to suck it up

309
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:33,830
and be a man about this.

310
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:34,883
No.

311
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:38,601
It's always been me and him together,
being awesome,

312
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:41,053
while the rest of
you walked two-by-two

313
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:43,830
onto your ark of
sexless boredom.

314
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:45,670
Just because James
is getting married

315
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:47,480
doesn't mean things
are going to change.

316
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:50,812
Yeah. Like things haven't
changed with you people.

317
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:54,152
Look, my sister married
a guy I didn't like.

318
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,583
Sandals and socks--
come on, buddy.

319
00:13:56,597 --> 00:13:58,740
But I took her out,
we celebrated.

320
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:00,113
It was the right thing to do.

321
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:01,872
You got to support him.

322
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,682
You're right, Ted.

323
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:08,531
This is a cause
for celebration.

324
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:11,953
We need to take him out and
celebrate the commitment

325
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:14,260
he and Tom are about to make.

326
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:18,872
Yeah. This is where
we're celebrating

327
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:21,401
the commitment that Tom
and I are about to make?

328
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,730
What? Yeah!

329
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:25,951
See, that cage represents
your commitment.

330
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:35,180
Oh, my God. Freedom
has never tasted so delicious.

331
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:36,451
Hey.

332
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:38,111
You work out?

333
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,552
I do.

334
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:41,352
And thank you for noticing.

335
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:43,570
You're obviously in very
good shape yourself.

336
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:45,140
Well, I try.

337
00:14:45,156 --> 00:14:46,751
So you want to dance?

338
00:14:47,097 --> 00:14:49,471
You know what?
I'm very flattered, and, objectively,

339
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:52,651
you're a very attractive man,
but this is actually my fiancée.

340
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:55,311
I'm sorry.
You know, I saw your drink and I...

341
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:58,170
No, no, this isn't my drink.
This is hers.

342
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:00,033
No, it isn't.

343
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:01,890
Whatever.

344
00:15:01,907 --> 00:15:03,212
How 'bout you?

345
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:04,782
Oh, I'm straight, too.

346
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:06,730
But I thank you for your time,

347
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:09,733
and I appreciate your
interest in my body.

348
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:12,973
You see that?

349
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:15,013
Being hit on doesn't
have to be terrible.

350
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:18,192
I feel flattered,
and everyone left with their dignity.

351
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:22,511
Hey, I really like
your sweater.

352
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:25,273
Wow. You actually do,
don't you?

353
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:27,722
You're not checking out
my boobs or anything.

354
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:30,060
My name's Gay Ken,
what do you think?

355
00:15:30,077 --> 00:15:32,423
I love this place! Let's dance!

356
00:15:32,435 --> 00:15:35,070
- And not be groped!
- Whoo! Thank you.

357
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:40,120
- Damn.
- Thank you!

358
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:43,210
- We're hot.
- Totally.

359
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,393
And then Tom says to the dealer

360
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:50,193
that the handmade Georgian
clock has a chip on the corner.

361
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:53,370
Blam, we get that puppy half price.
What up?!

362
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,653
Bam!

363
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:59,413
Sounds like you really rocked
that arts and crafts fair.

364
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,810
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

365
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:03,703
Hey, oh, my God.
This is so liberating,

366
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:05,890
being able to talk
about this to you.

367
00:16:05,908 --> 00:16:07,493
I cannot wait for
you to meet Tom.

368
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:10,021
And I cannot wait for you
to meet my good friend...

369
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,421
this guy.

370
00:16:11,685 --> 00:16:13,833
Excuse me, do you know anyone
who would like to buy

371
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:16,843
my incredibly muscular, fun,
large-handed brother a drink?

372
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:20,813
Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you,
Barnaby. Okay.

373
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:25,973
All right. I spy a group of women
who have let their defenses down

374
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,800
because they are in a gay club.

375
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,390
You see that chick right there?

376
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:32,830
She looks like she'd fall for
sports agent and football player.

377
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:34,210
Okay, I'm in.

378
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,742
Which one am I?

379
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:37,211
Please.

380
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:42,022
He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil,
and drops his pants

381
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:44,631
after three dirty martinis.
Now go, man, go!

382
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:53,290
I just never thought I'd
see Barney so vulnerable.

383
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:56,062
Well, I guess no one wants to feel like
they're going through the world alone.

384
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:58,820
Look at me,
in a yummy sandwich!

385
00:16:58,836 --> 00:17:01,972
Okay, we're actually right in the
middle of something right now, so...

386
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:04,831
Ooh, I know what I want to be
in the middle of. Thoughts?

387
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:07,231
God, can't two straight guys
come to a gay dance club,

388
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:09,980
enjoy some techno and good
conversation without being bothered?

389
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:16,533
How's it going, guys?
Still enjoying the attentions of men?

390
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:19,372
That's like the eighth guy
who's hit on us in ten minutes.

391
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:21,842
It's like, hello,
my eyes are up here.

392
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:23,302
And  it's never the hot ones.

393
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:25,632
It's always the losers.
Bums me out!

394
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:28,191
Looks like the boys
learned their lesson.

395
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:29,821
Do you totally
miss being hit on?

396
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:31,630
Oh, totally.
Let's go find a sports bar.

397
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:36,091
James, James,
since you like arts and crafts,

398
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:39,720
look at what Charles here
made with cherry stems.

399
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:41,611
He did it with his tongue.

400
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,821
Yeah.

401
00:17:42,836 --> 00:17:43,543
Barney.

402
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:46,833
So, Charles, why don't you put
your number in my brother's phone,

403
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:48,050
and once he's in
a funner mood...

404
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:49,903
Barney, Barney,
I don't want his number.

405
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:52,721
I don't want anyone's
number, okay?

406
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:54,230
I'm getting married.

407
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:55,760
Wow.

408
00:17:55,818 --> 00:17:57,930
- Best of luck to you both.
- Thank you.

409
00:17:57,945 --> 00:17:59,510
My number's in here.

410
00:17:59,526 --> 00:18:01,261
I'm very discreet.

411
00:18:02,655 --> 00:18:04,361
Okay, okay, excuse me.

412
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,110
Barney, family talk.

413
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,281
Okay, dude,
you have got to stop this, okay?

414
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,240
I know that my getting married is
threatening to your way of life...

415
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:12,783
Oh, so now it's my way of life?

416
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:14,970
I thought it was
our way of life.

417
00:18:14,985 --> 00:18:17,192
You've completely
turned your back on it.

418
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,911
Look at you,
not even suited up.

419
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:21,261
Do you remember why
we suit up, James?

420
00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:22,490
To get laid.

421
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:24,550
To show people that
we are different

422
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:27,990
from the millions of T-shirt
and jeans lemmings out there.

423
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:30,590
The suit shows that we are
a force to be reckoned with,

424
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:33,133
a two-person army that
plays by its own rules.

425
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:35,652
But you've taken off the uniform,
you've crossed enemy lines,

426
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:36,831
and you've abandoned me.

427
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:38,200
Well, I'm not gonna
let you do that.

428
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:41,891
It's not too late to back out
of this stupid marriage thing!

429
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:43,563
You don't have to do this, bro!

430
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:44,832
- Yes, I do.
- Why?!

431
00:18:44,846 --> 00:18:47,450
Because Tom and I are
gonna have a baby.

432
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:49,501
What? There's gonna be a baby?

433
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:53,813
Yes. We're adopting.

434
00:18:53,937 --> 00:18:57,530
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna be an uncle?

435
00:18:57,696 --> 00:18:59,431
For the rest of your life.

436
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:05,403
And that's how Barney
became Uncle Barney.

437
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:07,421
A year later,
at James's wedding,

438
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:09,351
Barney could not have
been more proud.

439
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:11,033
To James and Tom.

440
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:13,611
May you have a long and
happy life together.

441
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:16,833
And may I always have the skin
and libido of a much younger man.

442
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:18,411
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

443
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:20,590
Nice one.

444
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:24,001
Thanks. I decided to leave
out the hetero college phase.

445
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:25,422
No one wants to
hear about that.

446
00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:26,811
It was perfect.

447
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:29,061
You even made Tom's dad cry.

448
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:32,020
Might have been doing that
because he's a Republican.

449
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:34,580
Whoa.

450
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:36,070
It's 9:00.

451
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:38,550
We should be getting back.
You guys want to split a cab?

452
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:40,450
Uh, no, I think I'm gonna
stay a little bit longer.

453
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:42,550
Yeah, me, too.
I'm not tired at all.

454
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:44,861
All right, well, it's getting late.
Got to get the wife home.

455
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:47,212
Oh, stop calling me that.
It makes me sound fat.

456
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:51,043
Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.

457
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:07,201
- May I?
- Yeah.

458
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,941
Hey, buddy.

459
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:17,083
Your parents are married.

460
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:18,992
Now, listen, you.

461
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:21,532
Just because you're being
raised by married people

462
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:24,052
doesn't mean you have to
choose that lifestyle.

463
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:25,193
High-five.

464
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:28,171
Luckily, you got me.

465
00:20:28,338 --> 00:20:31,840
In 20 and a half years,
you'll be 21,

466
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,701
and I will be...

467
00:20:34,057 --> 00:20:36,460
Well, I haven't decided
how old I'll be yet.

468
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,822
But we are gonna bro out,
uncle and nephew style.

469
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,501
Stick with me, kid.

470
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:45,550
I am gonna teach
you how to live.

471
00:20:46,156 --> 00:20:48,701
Great suit, by the way.

472
00:20:52,088 --> 00:20:53,752
Who is the cutest?

473
00:21:01,148 --> 00:21:02,622
I don't get it.

474
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:05,732
Tom liked my breasts
in tenth grade.

475
00:21:06,236 --> 00:21:08,711
Why doesn't he like them now?

476
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:10,962
Why?

477
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:15,202
Rosa, why always be attracted
to the unavailable ones?

478
00:21:15,218 --> 00:21:17,481
Why not accept the fact that
you're a beautiful woman

479
00:21:17,497 --> 00:21:19,522
who is worthy of love?

480
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:21,813
Are you brave enough
to hear that?

481
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:23,042
You...
