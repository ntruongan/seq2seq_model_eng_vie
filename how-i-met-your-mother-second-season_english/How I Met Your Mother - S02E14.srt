1
00:00:01,116 --> 00:00:04,300
Kids, I told you stories
about all the big holidays--

2
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:05,649
Christmas...

3
00:00:06,162 --> 00:00:07,367
Halloween...

4
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:09,548
Thanksgiving...

5
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,279
but one holiday was
always my favorite--

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,043
Super Bowl Sunday.

7
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:17,864
And there was one
Super Bowl back in 2007

8
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:19,524
that I will never forget.

9
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:21,087
Marshall, you're
on beer detail.

10
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:22,980
Lily, you're making
the bean dip.

11
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:25,098
Uh, Robin,
you're on chips and pretzels,

12
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:26,773
and Barney,
I'm giving you nothing to do

13
00:00:26,787 --> 00:00:29,614
so you can just focus on
controlling your gambling problem.

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,093
"Problem."

15
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:33,362
Oh, poor Superman,
he should really do something

16
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,432
about his flying problem.

17
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:38,263
It's not a problem if
you're awesome at it.

18
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:42,343
And I will be going to Quinn's to
pick up the world's greatest food,

19
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:44,611
the Super Bowl
Hot Wings Platter.

20
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:47,490
If I were a chicken,
I'd go cannibal for those bad boys.

21
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,340
Just eat my own damn wing off.
I don't care.

22
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:51,291
I'm crazy like that.

23
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:53,981
Here's the info
for tomorrow night.

24
00:00:53,996 --> 00:00:55,163
What's tomorrow night?

25
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:57,683
Oh, God, you didn't hear?

26
00:00:58,075 --> 00:00:59,572
Mark died.

27
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:02,511
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.

28
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:04,272
The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00,
and I know

29
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:06,720
it would have meant a
lot to Mark if you came.

30
00:01:06,925 --> 00:01:09,631
You guys were his
favorite customers.

31
00:01:10,146 --> 00:01:13,160
- Stay strong.
- We're so sorry.

32
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,410
Who was Mark?

33
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:19,762
- No idea.
- Not a clue.

34
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:23,732
Well, I guess we
should go, right?

35
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:28,020
Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00,
that's the Super Bowl.

36
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:31,902
Okay, I feel terrible,
but the truth is we didn't know Mike.

37
00:01:31,915 --> 00:01:32,770
- Mark.
- Mark,

38
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:34,822
and as long as we send flowers,

39
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:36,992
I can't think of any
reason we'd have to go.

40
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,253
Get out of here!

41
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:41,063
I never want to see your
face in this bar again!

42
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:46,751
This soulless bastard just told me
he can't come to Mark's funeral

43
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:48,971
because he wants to
watch the Super Bowl.

44
00:01:48,988 --> 00:01:50,872
Could you believe that?

45
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,281
You guys are coming, right?

46
00:01:54,295 --> 00:01:56,451
Yes... Wouldn't
miss for the world.

47
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:13,313
Okay, here's the plan :

48
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:15,482
record the game,
go to the funeral,

49
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:17,240
- pay our respects to Matt...
- Mark.

50
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:20,611
Mark, and start watching
only an hour late.

51
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:23,830
Okay, that's great,
but just to make sure it records,

52
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:25,610
maybe we should bow our
heads and say a quiet prayer

53
00:02:25,648 --> 00:02:27,261
to the TiVo gods.

54
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,592
Almighty TiVo,

55
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:34,691
we thank you for all the
gifts you have given us:

56
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:37,010
the power to freeze live
TV to go take a leak

57
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:38,892
is nothing short of Godlike.

58
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:42,173
Let's not forget fast-forwarding
through commercials.

59
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:45,131
It seems greedy to ask
anything more from you,

60
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:47,040
O magic box,

61
00:02:47,107 --> 00:02:50,942
but if you malfunction
and miss the Super Bowl,

62
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,472
we will destroy you in the
alley with baseball bats.

63
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:54,740
- Amen.
- Amen.

64
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,072
We are not fast-forwarding
through the commercials.

65
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:58,261
Yeah, they're the best part.

66
00:02:58,277 --> 00:03:00,151
Oh, come on.
Remember last year?

67
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:03,613
Who wants to watch a monkey in
a coconut bra order a pizza?

68
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:06,062
Oh, my God.
This monkey was so cute.

69
00:03:07,468 --> 00:03:10,132
Seriously, that's the last
time I'm gonna call you today.

70
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,302
Okay.

71
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,973
Good-bye.

72
00:03:13,498 --> 00:03:15,221
You  didn't hang up either!

73
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:17,081
I know! You hang up!

74
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:18,681
You hang up!

75
00:03:20,337 --> 00:03:22,251
My bookie. Great guy.

76
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:25,803
So let me get this straight. A funeral
is the one time you don't suit up?

77
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:27,753
Have I taught you nothing, Ted?

78
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:29,031
Virtually.

79
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:31,113
Suits are full of joy.

80
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:34,490
They're the sartorial
equivalent of a baby's smile.

81
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:35,591
"Sartorial"?

82
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:37,673
"Of or pertaining to
tailors or their trade."

83
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:39,552
Suits are for the living.

84
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,220
That's why when it's
my time to R.I.P.

85
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:43,431
I'm going out of this world
the same way I came into it--

86
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:45,851
buck naked. Yeah.

87
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:47,281
It's gonna be awesome.

88
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:50,423
Open bar for the guys,
open casket for the ladies.

89
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:52,132
What up?!

90
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:25,783
- Such a waste.
- I know.

91
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,342
He was so young.

92
00:04:27,356 --> 00:04:30,763
A hand-stitched, cashmere,
double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana.

93
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:32,832
It must be so frightened.

94
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:35,122
This is going faster
than I thought.

95
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:37,113
We'll make an appearance
at the bar for the wake,

96
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,092
we'll be watching
the game by 8:00.

97
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:41,700
And even though we
didn't see any whales,

98
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:45,141
Mark and I both said it was
the best day of our lives.

99
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:48,313
Okay, I'm getting
us another round.

100
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,142
And when I come back,

101
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,130
everyone else is telling
their favorite Mark story.

102
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,201
Dibs on the one Carl just told.

103
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:02,390
Okay, I have to be at work
exactly one Super Bowl from now.

104
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:04,381
Oh, let's face it,
we're not going to get to watch it.

105
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:06,061
We should just find
out the score.

106
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:07,520
Oh, thank God! I'll find out.

107
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:10,202
No, no, no, we can't!
We have to watch the game together.

108
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:11,461
It's tradition.

109
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:14,412
Think of all the great times
we've had watching this game.

110
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:17,203
Second down, everyone drink.

111
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,783
Ted, it's not a drinking game

112
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:22,230
if you drink anytime
anything happens.

113
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:24,481
Are these chicken
wings or angel wings?

114
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:26,421
God, I love these things.

115
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:28,573
I love you guys.

116
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:32,190
This is so great, all of us
watching the Super Bowl together.

117
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,250
This is special.

118
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:38,052
We need to do this every year--
promise me!

119
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:39,540
Calm down, buddy.

120
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:41,172
Oh, commercials!

121
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:42,893
Everyone drink!

122
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:49,693
God, this is such a great tradition,
all of us watching the game together.

123
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:51,440
How did this start?

124
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:54,322
Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks
that Casey misses this field goal.

125
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:56,801
I don't bet.
Betting's for suckers.

126
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:59,492
Make it like a dollar or something,
you know. Who cares? No big deal.

127
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,203
Fine.

128
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:04,872
See, there you go, he made it.
You win.

129
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:07,863
Wait. This is mine,
just like that?

130
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:10,172
God, that feels good.

131
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:12,911
No, that feels really... good.

132
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:14,331
What else can we bet on?

133
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:16,422
Nothing, it's the
halftime show.

134
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:19,151
Oh, so lame.

135
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,870
Nobody even pays attention.

136
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:23,712
I mean, Janet Jackson,
who cares?

137
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:29,992
God, how cool is Robin?

138
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:32,740
I  can't believe you invited this girl
we've only known for a few months

139
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:34,352
to our sacred day.

140
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:36,052
Now she's gonna be
in all the pictures.

141
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,592
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
I'll give you the Seahawks

142
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:39,480
plus six points for 500 bucks.

143
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:41,550
Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.

144
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:43,468
$50?! What fun is $50?!

145
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:46,683
Why don't we just bet air?!
God, Marshall!

146
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,004
Okay, $50.

147
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:49,280
Hey, I'll take that action.

148
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:51,640
Seahawks, but make it four
points and make it a grand.

149
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:54,501
Hey, these wings,
are they chicken wings or angel wings?

150
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,781
Oh, commercials!

151
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:58,890
Monkey with a coconut
bra. Hilarious.

152
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:02,693
Look, we always watch
the Super Bowl together.

153
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,423
So we make a pact to
watch it tomorrow at 6:00

154
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:08,092
and go the next 18 hours
without finding out who won.

155
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:09,790
That's impossible.

156
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:11,923
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It's not gonna be easy.

157
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:14,580
That means no TV, no Internet,

158
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:16,340
no newspapers, nothing.

159
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:18,032
Media blackout.

160
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:19,763
But our tradition lives on.

161
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:21,432
Who's in?

162
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:23,550
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

163
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:25,403
- I'm in.
- What the hell, I'm in.

164
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:28,490
- High five!
- Dude, we're at a wake.

165
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:31,422
Sorry. Solemn low five.

166
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:37,101
As the day began, none of us had
any idea how hard it would be

167
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:40,561
to go nine hours without hearing
the outcome of the Super Bowl.

168
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:43,001
I decided to work from home
to avoid contamination

169
00:07:43,015 --> 00:07:45,122
by the outside world.

170
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:52,541
Hey, take this key
and swallow it.

171
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,630
What? No.

172
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:56,433
Come on, Ted, you eat salads.
It'll be out by game time.

173
00:07:56,446 --> 00:07:58,210
Lots more, no.

174
00:07:58,226 --> 00:07:59,861
I'm not messing
around, Theodore.

175
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:02,400
I've got a lot of money
riding on this game.

176
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,563
If I don't handcuff
myself to this radiator,

177
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:06,850
I'll check the score.
Please take the key.

178
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:07,960
Fine.

179
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:09,790
But only because you didn't
think through a bathroom plan

180
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:11,920
and I think that's funny.

181
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:23,292
The media blackout was
particularly hard on Robin

182
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:25,863
because, well,
she was the media.

183
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,153
But unfortunately,
the City won't be fixing

184
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,641
the unusually large
pothole any time soon,

185
00:08:30,658 --> 00:08:33,412
so buckle up if
you're on the BQE.

186
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:35,360
It's gonna be a bumpy one.

187
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:37,921
Like  morning commutes
needed to get any harder.

188
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,572
You're right, Kevin.

189
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:43,100
Well, Robin, what do you say?
I think it's time to check in with Sid

190
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:45,302
- for a sports update.
- No!

191
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,893
- What?
- No.

192
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,740
But it's, uh, time for Sports.

193
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:54,620
No, it's not.
It's time for Weather.

194
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:56,910
We, we just did Weather.

195
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:59,272
Well, weather's pretty fickle,

196
00:08:59,286 --> 00:09:00,512
it may have changed.

197
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,892
What's it doing out there, Lou?

198
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,641
Pretty much the same thing
it was two minutes ago.

199
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:10,803
Back to you, Robin.

200
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:15,371
Okay, now it's time for Sports.

201
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:18,261
No! Let's go to Traffic Todd

202
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:20,312
in the Metro News
1 Gridlock Chopper.

203
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,331
Robin, it's time for Sports!

204
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,940
Over to you, Sid.

205
00:09:27,338 --> 00:09:30,750
Thank you, Kevin and Robin.

206
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:33,402
Let's talk about
the Super Bowl.

207
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:35,852
Weeks earlier,
Marshall had promised Lily

208
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,832
he'd come into her kindergarten
class for show-and-tell day.

209
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:41,313
And he's a little
bit double-jointed...

210
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:44,973
And his favorite animal
is the Loch Ness monster.

211
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:46,711
Lily, how many times...?

212
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:48,482
Nessie is a gentle creature.

213
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:51,422
We're  trying to stay away
from terms like "Monster."

214
00:09:51,906 --> 00:09:55,453
Well, I think we can all agree,
he is much more interesting

215
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,741
than Sally's one-eyed goldfish.

216
00:09:57,757 --> 00:10:00,341
Three weeks in a row?
Come on, Sally.

217
00:10:01,055 --> 00:10:03,592
Okay, well,
that's all the time we have.

218
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,592
Arts and crafts, everybody.

219
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:11,033
Hey. I'm Doug.

220
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:13,201
Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.

221
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:17,671
Are you going to be staying
here for the rest of day?

222
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:19,581
Yeah, I'm actually
trying to hide out

223
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:21,911
'cause I don't want to know
who won the Super Bowl.

224
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:23,863
I know who won.

225
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:26,552
Oh, um, that's great,
but I really don't want to know,

226
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,830
so  if you could just
keep that to yourself.

227
00:10:28,997 --> 00:10:32,762
How badly do you
not want to know?

228
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:34,841
Excuse me?

229
00:10:34,855 --> 00:10:36,832
Ten bucks.

230
00:10:37,026 --> 00:10:38,423
Are you serious?

231
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:40,683
Just went up to eight.

232
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:42,921
Unlock me, Ted.

233
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:45,242
I've never gone this long
without calling my bookie.

234
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:46,731
He worries.

235
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:49,352
Not until game time.

236
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,530
Where are you going?

237
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:52,893
Pick up the hot wings.

238
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:55,522
What? How the hell are
you planning on getting

239
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:57,822
in and out of a sports bar
without seeing the score?

240
00:10:57,837 --> 00:10:59,040
There's TVs everywhere.

241
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,581
Ah, don't worry.

242
00:11:00,596 --> 00:11:02,093
I got it all planned out.

243
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:03,592
First of all:

244
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:05,843
I placed duct tape on
a pair of sunglasses

245
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:08,262
so I can only see out
of two tiny holes.

246
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:12,061
Next, I constructed blinders
out of an old cereal box.

247
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:14,901
Top it all off:
high-tech noise-reducing headphones

248
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:16,923
I bought when Marshall and
Lily first got back together

249
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:18,463
and were doing it a lot.

250
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:22,271
I call it the Sensory
Deprivator 5000.

251
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,702
Hello! Uh,
my name is Ted Mosby.

252
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm here to pick
up my hot wings.

253
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:51,882
In my hand, you'll find the
exact total for the wings

254
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:53,832
plus a generous tip.

255
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,440
Please take the cash.

256
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,541
Put the wings in my hand
and I'll be on my way.

257
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:02,073
Thank you!

258
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:10,433
And that closes the book on
one heck of a Super Bowl.

259
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:12,461
Back to you, Kevin and Robin.

260
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,541
We'll be right back.

261
00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:21,373
And we're clear.

262
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:22,762
I'm sorry.

263
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,393
Um, Robin, is it just me,

264
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:25,872
or were you doing
something different there?

265
00:12:25,907 --> 00:12:27,820
I haven't watched the game yet.

266
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:29,350
I'm begging you,
for the rest of the newscast

267
00:12:29,385 --> 00:12:32,142
there can't be any references
to who won the Super Bowl.

268
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:33,852
I mean,
change the teleprompter.

269
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:35,951
No team names,
nothing specific.

270
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:38,472
That is crazy. I can't do that.

271
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,461
My friend Mark passed
away this week.

272
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:44,983
Okay, sweety okay.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

273
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:46,920
Back in five... four...

274
00:12:46,936 --> 00:12:48,893
- three...
- It's just so hard.

275
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:19,372
Ha! Who's the idiot now?!

276
00:13:19,386 --> 00:13:22,642
You said the Sensory
Deprivator 5000 was stupid.

277
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:24,242
But it totally worked!

278
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:26,981
I couldn't see or hear
anything happening around me.

279
00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:29,330
Right?! Right?!

280
00:13:30,648 --> 00:13:32,260
No...!

281
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:35,303
And if that weren't bad enough,

282
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:37,823
I was about to have a
horrible realization.

283
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:39,721
Where's the dipping sauce?

284
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,521
The team that won, want to know
what their name rhymes with?

285
00:13:45,538 --> 00:13:47,490
Come on, dude.
You promised you'd stop

286
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:49,462
if I ate all those crayons.

287
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:51,481
Why are you doing this?

288
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:54,701
I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.

289
00:13:55,387 --> 00:13:58,902
Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin,
she's mine.

290
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,633
Okay, now who did this?

291
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:15,351
I did.

292
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:18,183
Does that mean Marshall
gets a time-out?

293
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:21,232
Well, Marshall's
a grownup, so...

294
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:24,321
When one of us breaks something,
we get a time-out.

295
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,981
Sorry.

296
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:35,860
And after the Super Bowl,

297
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,733
the mayor of the losing
team's city had to pay up,

298
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,660
sending the mayor of
the winning team's city

299
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:45,133
15 pounds of a delicacy his
or her city is famous for.

300
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:48,700
Better fire up whatever type of grill,
steamer or fryer

301
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:53,260
one might use to cook that delicacy,
Winning Team's Mayor.

302
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,283
Hey.

303
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,471
- Hey.
- I'm not talking to you.

304
00:14:58,486 --> 00:14:59,742
Yes, you are.

305
00:14:59,757 --> 00:15:01,640
You'll do whatever I say.

306
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:04,450
- Hold your breath.
- I'm not holding my breath.

307
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:06,312
The winning team was the...

308
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:09,381
Now here's how this
is going to work:

309
00:15:09,397 --> 00:15:12,561
you're going to take me to
three R-rated movies a week...

310
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,573
And then Uncle
Marshall got an idea.

311
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:16,750
It was not one he was
proud of in retrospect,

312
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:18,893
but desperate times...

313
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,161
Oh, no.

314
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,453
Somebody wet their pants.

315
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:28,953
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, really?

316
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:30,233
Who's everyone gonna believe?

317
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:32,351
I'm a grownup third-year
law student at Columbia

318
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:35,873
and you're just a little pants wetter.
So now I ask you a question:

319
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:38,843
You want to be able to quietly sneak
off to the restroom and dry off

320
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,600
or am I gonna have something
for show and tell today?

321
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:44,260
- Hey, everyone...
- Okay, okay.

322
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,010
You win.

323
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:47,812
I want my money back.

324
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:53,870
And your pudding snack pack.

325
00:15:58,455 --> 00:16:00,431
Sir, who won the Super Bowl?

326
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:02,040
Sorry. I missed the game.

327
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:03,693
You missed...?!
How could he miss...?

328
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:05,480
Excuse me!
Who won the Super Bowl?!

329
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:07,522
I... don't really
follow sports.

330
00:16:07,537 --> 00:16:09,071
Oh, my...!

331
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,310
Emmitt Smith!

332
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:13,992
Oh, thank God.

333
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:15,591
Yeah, I get that a lot.

334
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:18,123
You got to tell me,
who won the Super Bowl?

335
00:16:18,136 --> 00:16:20,351
The game was last night?

336
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:23,322
You know, once you win two
or three of those things,

337
00:16:23,337 --> 00:16:25,972
it's kind of like, eh.

338
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:28,912
But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a
football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday.

339
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,192
What could possibly be more
important than football?!

340
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:36,412
Dance, my friend. Dance.

341
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:41,743
No...!

342
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,343
Hello! It's me again.

343
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:05,292
Oh! I didn't recognize you.

344
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:08,573
Yeah, you forgot to give
me the dipping sauce!

345
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:14,533
Ah. Yes.

346
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:15,903
This is the one.

347
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:19,703
It was 4:00, and so far,
all of us had done the impossible.

348
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:22,583
But then,
almost simultaneously,

349
00:17:22,596 --> 00:17:24,322
things started to go wrong.

350
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,480
And let's end the
day on a happy note.

351
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:28,441
There is a new arrival
at the Bronx Zoo.

352
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:31,141
Trish Sanchez has the story.

353
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:44,732
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, dude, look out.

354
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:49,303
And in honor of
yesterday's big win...

355
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,782
- Hey, buddy, look out.
- Dude, watch out!

356
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:04,252
...the zoo decided to
name the baby panda

357
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:06,381
after Super Bowl champions...

358
00:18:06,398 --> 00:18:07,812
No...!

359
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:10,992
No...!

360
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:13,410
No...!

361
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:26,281
Yes...!

362
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:33,510
Awesome. Just in
time for kick-off.

363
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:35,300
None of you guys found
out the score, right?

364
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:37,112
- Mission accomplished.
- Didn't find out.

365
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:39,530
Great. Let's do it.
I already fast-forwarded

366
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:43,073
through the four hours of pre-game
coverage. So we are ready.

367
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:45,923
Barney, I can't
even look at you.

368
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:47,641
I don't want any
sign of who won.

369
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:50,352
Don't worry,
I'm not going to give anything away.

370
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:52,143
Feel free to start without me.

371
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,113
Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

372
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:59,141
So much money!
You screwed it up, Barney!

373
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:02,450
You screwed everything up!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

374
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,033
Okay,  let's watch the game.

375
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:07,890
Barney, what the hell was that?
We know who you bet on.

376
00:19:07,907 --> 00:19:10,242
Now you've ruined the
game for everyone.

377
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:12,871
Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.

378
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:14,022
Way to blow it.

379
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:16,690
Yeah, I didn't know
and now I do know.

380
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:19,802
There's no point in
even watching the game.

381
00:19:26,736 --> 00:19:28,980
Well, at least the
commercials aren't ruined.

382
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,713
Wings are still good.

383
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:32,500
Beer still works.

384
00:19:35,236 --> 00:19:36,702
Ah, what the hell.

385
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:38,801
Let's watch Barney
lose some money.

386
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:41,402
Hey, so check this out:

387
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:44,033
I got extorted by a
five-year-old today.

388
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:46,313
I almost got fired today.

389
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:47,770
I met Emmitt Smith today.

390
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:48,932
Ooh, you go first.

391
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:51,311
I tried out the Sensory
Deprivator 5000.

392
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:53,092
Yeah, go ahead, Barney.

393
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:55,631
Well, I was frantically
running down the street

394
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:57,492
trying to find out the
score to the game...

395
00:19:57,507 --> 00:19:59,001
And here's the funny part,

396
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:01,430
as unforgettable as
that Super Bowl was,

397
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:05,410
here it is 23 years later and
I don't remember who won...

398
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:07,842
Hell, I don't even
remember who played.

399
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:10,421
What I do remember is
that we drank beer,

400
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:17,290
I didn't only lose the game,
I lost every single prop bet.

401
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:20,802
Total penalty yardage,
number of replay-challenges,

402
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:21,873
coin toss...

403
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:24,312
What are the odds of
losing the coin toss?

404
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:26,182
50-50, give or take.

405
00:20:26,556 --> 00:20:30,553
Interceptions, field-goals,
total sacks,

406
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:33,753
whether or not there'd
be a safety, first...
