1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,997
Kids, in the spring of 2007, everything
was great between me and Robin.

2
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:06,546
So we decided to try
and make it even better.

3
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:08,512
We decided to move in together.

4
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:10,442
So, I can have the moving
truck here by 8:00 am.

5
00:00:10,473 --> 00:00:11,835
Does that sound
good to everybody?

6
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:14,925
By the way,
what are you guys doing with Ted's room?

7
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:16,894
'Cause if you need help with the rent,
I'll take it.

8
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:18,702
Why would you want
to live with us?

9
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,150
I don't call what
you guys do "living."

10
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:25,495
Here's the deal,
I need a room closer to the bar.

11
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:27,968
It takes me exactly 23 minutes

12
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:30,694
to get a girl from the
bar back to my apartment.

13
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:33,345
A lot can go wrong
in 23 minutes.

14
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:38,169
This is going to be so hot.

15
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:46,200
She's paying.

16
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:50,979
I swear,
if he doesn't call me back,

17
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,401
I'm going to go
through with this.

18
00:00:52,456 --> 00:00:53,594
Please hurry, sir.

19
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:55,865
I want to do dirty
stuff with you.

20
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:58,160
Stuff I won't let him do.

21
00:00:58,217 --> 00:01:00,573
Every red light run
is an extra $20.

22
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:02,729
Baby?

23
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:05,823
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
It was all my fault.

24
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:10,288
I am so drunk.

25
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:15,568
When I'm this drunk,
I go crazy!

26
00:01:15,624 --> 00:01:17,292
I bet you do.

27
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:18,734
Check this out.

28
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:23,423
What up NYPD?

29
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,398
So close.

30
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:30,383
See? If I had a room here all I
have to do is get them upstairs.

31
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:32,374
Come on, guys. It'll be great!

32
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,441
We'll come in after
you guys are asleep

33
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,213
and I'll be gone
before you wake up.

34
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:40,080
So, you get to have sex and we get to
wake some skanky girl up in the morning

35
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:41,550
and kick her out?

36
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:42,781
God, Lily.

37
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,596
Some guy just told her that he loved
her then pretended to go to the bathroom

38
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:48,050
and never came back
you can't make her a cup of coffee?

39
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:49,434
Real nice.

40
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:53,931
Sync by vNaru

41
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:08,285
I put all your heavy jackets
in this box marked "winter."

42
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:13,061
And all your colorful sweaters
in this box marked "Bill Cosby."

43
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:16,496
Make fun,
but America loved that guy for a reason.

44
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:18,753
Wow!

45
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,095
Almost done.

46
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:21,495
Not so fast.

47
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:26,373
Take your sword.

48
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:28,067
Wow.

49
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:30,061
- End of an era.
- Yeah.

50
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:33,375
It's a bummer to break up the set,
but you're going to need that sword.

51
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:36,491
It's true--
my building is infested with dragons.

52
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,396
Looks like our little boy
is finally moving out.

53
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,945
It seems like just yesterday
he was a cute little freshmen.

54
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:47,981
Discovering Reggae
and ultimate Frisbee.

55
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:50,475
He did it later than the other
kids but we never pushed him.

56
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:52,015
We knew he'd get there.

57
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:54,348
You haven't moved in yet,
have you?

58
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:56,033
Good. You guys have
to take this quiz.

59
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:57,415
I found it in a magazine.

60
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,428
It's called the "Are you ready
to move in together?" quiz.

61
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:03,424
Well, if it's anything like you're
"Are you wearing panties" quiz,

62
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,768
I'm out.

63
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:06,620
Question one,

64
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:09,703
Ted, "Do you want to
move in with Robin?"

65
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:10,638
Mm. Yes.

66
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,398
Oh, you got the
first one wrong.

67
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:15,464
The answer is "no," you
secretly want to be single

68
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,707
and hang out with your
awesome friend Barney."

69
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:19,089
Question two.

70
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:23,217
Robin, "Do you think you can
score a hotter guy than Ted?"

71
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:27,302
Correct. The answer
was awkward silence.

72
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:33,054
Question three, "Did I just make
up this quiz to prove a point?"

73
00:03:33,108 --> 00:03:34,175
Yes.

74
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:35,766
Yes, I did.

75
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:40,487
Really? You mean it's not from
Old Yellow Legal Pad Magazine?

76
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,410
So? We all agree?

77
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:44,894
We move Ted's
stuff back up here?

78
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:46,946
Mm... no.
We're still moving in together.

79
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:49,318
Why? This is crazy.

80
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:51,902
Ted you're throwing your life away.
This girl is blinding you.

81
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:55,007
With her shiny hair and
her boobed shaped boobs.

82
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,535
This is bad for you,
too, you know.

83
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,707
How are you going to feel when
he sees you without any makeup?

84
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:03,051
I'm not wearing
makeup right now.

85
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,427
Holy crap, you're beautiful.

86
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:10,633
All right then, how will you feel when
you can't sneak the occasional cigarette?

87
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,358
Oh, come on,
Robin doesn't smoke.

88
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:14,890
Wait, do you?

89
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:16,633
Of course not. Why?

90
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,698
Don't tell me how
to live my life!

91
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:22,385
Ted, I can't let you do this.

92
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:23,697
Come on. This is happening.

93
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:26,480
So instead of fighting it why,
why don't you just help?

94
00:04:27,947 --> 00:04:29,717
- You want me to help you?
- Yeah.

95
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,890
Okay, Ted.

96
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,043
I'll help you.

97
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,709
Can't believe we actually
got him to take a box down.

98
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:40,883
Maybe he's finally
getting on board.

99
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:43,560
Where's the truck?

100
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,021
Where's Barney?

101
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:47,836
Wait for it.

102
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:52,113
I can't believe this! Everything
I own in the world is in there.

103
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:55,056
Except for this
box of pot lids.

104
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:56,651
And the sword.

105
00:04:57,095 --> 00:05:00,528
I'm going to kill him.
I swear to God I'm going to kill him!

106
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,382
Right. Maybe I'll just hold on to that.
For now.

107
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:11,494
Marshall, we live alone.

108
00:05:13,203 --> 00:05:14,950
This is so great!

109
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:18,824
We can finally do all the things we always
said we wanted to do if we lived alone.

110
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:21,380
Oh, I know what I
want to start with.

111
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:29,124
So, here we are, right?

112
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:32,390
Sitting around the
apartment naked.

113
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:35,332
- Awesome.
- Yep.

114
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:41,653
It's not as awesome as
I thought it would be.

115
00:05:41,747 --> 00:05:43,917
- My butt itches.
- I'm cold.

116
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:45,268
I noticed.

117
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:49,507
Yeah, like you're
one to talk, Pointy.

118
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:54,122
Barney, I don't know if you
got my other 47 messages,

119
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:56,959
but if my stuff isn't here within
the hour I'm calling the cops.

120
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:59,081
This is the last time
I'm calling you.

121
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:01,706
Because my charger's in
the back of the truck.

122
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:04,551
Don't worry, it's Barney.
He'll bring the stuff back.

123
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:08,115
No, it's just... I was really looking
forward to settling in, you know?

124
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:09,811
Maybe setting up my TV.

125
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:11,841
Watching a movie in bed.

126
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,325
What?

127
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:17,071
Do we really want a
TV in the bedroom?

128
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,986
I thought we did.

129
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,628
I'm not sure that we do.

130
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:23,030
Well, where else
would we put my TV?

131
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:26,636
We could just put it in our
storage unit in the basement.

132
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:29,001
But wouldn't we miss my TV?

133
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:31,253
- Would we?
- Yes, we would.

134
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,977
We've had that TV
for a long time

135
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:38,117
and we would feel more at home
if it were setup in our bedroom.

136
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:43,152
- We need wine, don't we?
- Yes, we do.

137
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:52,237
Should we, um,
move this to the bedroom?

138
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:53,482
Why?

139
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:55,555
Ted doesn't live here anymore.

140
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:58,059
We can do it wherever we want.

141
00:06:58,185 --> 00:06:59,792
You know what else?

142
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:01,883
We don't have to
be quiet anymore.

143
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:04,266
We can be as loud as we want.

144
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:10,347
Okay, I think we need to
lay down some ground rules.

145
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:14,430
Just because we can be loud
doesn't mean we have to be loud.

146
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:16,970
And although it
might turn you on,

147
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:20,305
you screaming,
"I'm the best," doesn't do much for me.

148
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:25,391
Well, it's a lot better than yelling,
"Ted's not here," over and over again.

149
00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:28,006
Well, at least what
I said is true.

150
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:31,563
Well, that was unnecessary.

151
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:37,373
Well, since I only have one box I
figure I might as well unpack it.

152
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,676
Mm, where do you think
we should put it?

153
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:41,709
Well, unless you have a separate pot
lid room, I was thinking the cupboard.

154
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:43,833
What?

155
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,057
Uh, the thing is my
kitchen is kind of small.

156
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:48,471
And, um,
I already have a bunch of pot lids

157
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:51,425
and mine come with pots, so...

158
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:54,610
You're saying there's no way to make
room for the single box of stuff

159
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,252
I try to move into our place?

160
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:58,068
Well, why don't you just
take it down to the...

161
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,769
Do not say storage space.

162
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,173
I was going to say Dumpster.

163
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:05,330
Damn it, Robin,
this is all I have left in the world--

164
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,901
eight pot lids and a sword.

165
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:09,567
Yeah, about the sword.

166
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,241
Hello.

167
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:16,436
Put on the suit, Mr. Mosby.

168
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,971
Barney, I know it's you.
Where's my stuff?

169
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:20,193
It's not me.

170
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:22,336
If you want to see your
precious possessions again,

171
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,920
put on the suit.

172
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:24,829
What suit?

173
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:28,297
Ding-dong. Oh, what's that?
The doorbell.

174
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:31,590
That's the suit
I'm talking about.

175
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:32,743
I haven't gotten
to the door yet.

176
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,484
Oh, okay,
let me know when you get there.

177
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:38,583
Okay, I opened it.
And there's a suit there.

178
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:40,747
That's the suit
I'm talking about.

179
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,779
- Barney....
- This isn't Barney.

180
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:44,754
But I hear that guy's awesome.

181
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:47,818
All right.
Listen very carefully.

182
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:51,906
You will get your stuff back if you are
able to complete a series of challenges.

183
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:54,477
Number one, put on the suit.

184
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,325
Number two,
meet me at McClaren's in an hour.

185
00:08:57,377 --> 00:09:00,608
How will I know who to look
for since we've never met?

186
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:05,388
I look like Barney.

187
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:13,302
Oh, hey, Ted.

188
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:15,324
Suit and sneakers.

189
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:17,802
A little Ellen DeGeneres
but you pull it off.

190
00:09:17,854 --> 00:09:20,045
I don't have any other shoes
because you stole them along

191
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,907
with everything else
I own in the world.

192
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:23,408
Where's the truck, Barney?

193
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,783
Barney.

194
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:28,297
People's whose trucks I'm not
holding for ransom call me Barney.

195
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:31,573
I think you should
call me The Commodore.

196
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:35,347
- I'm not calling you...
- You're not getting your stuff back.

197
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:38,402
Can I please have
my stuff back...

198
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,198
The Commodore?

199
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:41,400
No.

200
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:44,173
Here's the deal,
Ted, you're my bro.

201
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,630
And you're about to become a henpecked,
beaten down, shell of a man.

202
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:53,840
So tonight, we are going to have one
last awesome night together as bros.

203
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,884
It's a bro-ing away party.

204
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:58,064
A special bro-casion.

205
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,869
A bro-choice rally.

206
00:09:59,922 --> 00:10:01,670
Bro-time at the Apollo.

207
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,133
Oh, bro me.

208
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:06,050
Well, so what do I have to do?

209
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:09,333
No, it's not what you have to do,
it's what you want to do,

210
00:10:09,388 --> 00:10:10,975
and you want to
have a good time

211
00:10:11,032 --> 00:10:14,133
before you go take Fun Ted
out back and shoot him.

212
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:16,666
So... first thing
on the docket...

213
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,600
- get me that girl's number.
- Absolutely not.

214
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:21,082
Mm. That's too bad.

215
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:24,008
Hey, hypothetical question:
if I was all your stuff,

216
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:27,576
would I rather be at the bottom
of the East River or The Hudson?

217
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:33,353
Hey, look,
world's strongest man is on.

218
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,529
Ooh, it's the one where
Lou Ferrigno pulls the bus

219
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:38,470
from the Partridge
family with his teeth.

220
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:40,975
It's the best one.
Hey, Ted, get in...

221
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,828
- We live alone.
- Yay.

222
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:52,806
Well, I win.

223
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:54,868
You need to give my
friend your phone number.

224
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:58,575
Wow, I really didn't think Lou
Ferrigno could pull that bus.

225
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:01,388
Are you sure this is live?
It looks pretty old.

226
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:04,124
Yeah, that's 'cause the,
uh, TV is old.

227
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,890
So, I'll, uh,
call you tomorrow?

228
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:11,978
Yeah. Um, not too early.
I have church.

229
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:16,753
You were impressive, buddy.

230
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:18,626
Nice work.
All right, next challenge.

231
00:11:18,681 --> 00:11:21,431
No. No next challenge. Look, this is
my first night living with Robin.

232
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:23,777
She's probably pissed I'm
spending it out with you.

233
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:29,385
This might be our last hurrah,
my little friend.

234
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,184
Marshall, I am gonna cook you
the best dinner of your life.

235
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:36,436
How would you like a...

236
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:42,298
one-egg omelet with
some ketchup and film?

237
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:45,422
Guess Ted's the one
who did the shopping.

238
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:48,537
Ooh, look, a microwave pizza!

239
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:54,084
Guess the microwave
was Ted's, too.

240
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:55,346
Yeah.

241
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:57,380
So were all the towels.

242
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,865
Turns out that everything that was
useful in this apartment was Ted's.

243
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:04,895
Everything that was a Foghat poster we
bought ironically in college was mine.

244
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,888
Marshall.

245
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,288
Yeah, baby?

246
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:10,090
I miss Ted.

247
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:12,636
Is it too soon to call him?

248
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:14,108
No, we shouldn't.

249
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:17,272
I don't want to interrupt his
first night living with Robin.

250
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,357
Ha, nice shooting.

251
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:23,935
You know, if we win this one it's free onion
rings at the Intergalactic Snack Shack.

252
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:24,956
What a bargain.

253
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,899
We only had to spend
20 bucks a game.

254
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,764
Admit it, you're having fun.

255
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:29,984
Maybe.

256
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,159
I mean, it was pretty funny when that
little girl fell over that space barrel.

257
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:38,346
Nice... We win.

258
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:42,593
Oh, walk of shame, walk of game--
what up?

259
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:44,416
Okay. Let's go one more.

260
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:46,881
- I don't know.
- You know you want to.

261
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,622
All right, let's do it--
I just got to call Robin real quick.

262
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:52,375
Oh, so that's what it's
gonna be like from now on?

263
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:56,642
No. Okay, okay. You call your old
lady and ask permission to have fun.

264
00:12:56,697 --> 00:13:01,560
Me, I will be at the Snack Shack eating
our victory onion rings Han style.

265
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:03,243
Solo.

266
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:11,037
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey, sweetie listen,

267
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,499
I'm really sorry but I'm gonna be
pretty late, so don't wait up.

268
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,853
Oh, it's totally fine.
You do what you got to do.

269
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,346
Thanks. You're the best.
I love you.

270
00:13:18,402 --> 00:13:20,189
I love you, too. Bye.

271
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,627
Hey, sorry about that.
Thanks for holding.

272
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,150
Um, so if you could go ahead and cancel
my subscription to Guns and Ammo,

273
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:28,423
that would be great.

274
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:31,338
No, it's a great magazine.
Really great.

275
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,162
They've printed
three of my letters.

276
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:34,815
It's just that my
boyfriend is moving in

277
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,558
and he kind of doesn't approve
of the whole gun thing.

278
00:13:39,287 --> 00:13:41,664
A free hand grenade phone?

279
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,962
You know what?
Let me give you my work address.

280
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,790
I did it, baby!

281
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:51,765
I got beer. I got food.

282
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,658
We don't need Ted anymore.

283
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:55,871
I am the provider of
this apartment now,

284
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:57,615
and I have provided!

285
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,820
"Provode"? Provided.

286
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,824
Anyway, I got us
everything we need.

287
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:04,768
Could you toss me
the toilet paper?

288
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:10,558
Be right back, baby. Sit tight.

289
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:16,588
Hey, I got to admit, um...
I didn't think I would, but, uh...

290
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,558
I had a really
good time tonight.

291
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:20,753
You're a good friend, Barney.

292
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:25,901
Hey, man, why don't you, uh...

293
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:28,377
why don't you tell me
where my truck is.

294
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,319
No, I don't think so.

295
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,973
Where's my truck?!

296
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:35,848
Do you know why I haven't given you
any of your possessions back yet?

297
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:39,794
Uh, because you're Admiral Jerk
of the British Royal Douchery?

298
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:42,408
Because you don't
want them back.

299
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:45,132
You could've left at any time tonight,
but you didn't, Ted.

300
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:46,167
Why is that?

301
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:48,477
Because I didn't want to go back
to Robin's without my stuff.

302
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:50,721
False. You know what I think?

303
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:54,057
I think you spent one day with
her and it already sucked.

304
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:56,731
I think you didn't like being there,
she didn't like having you there

305
00:14:56,768 --> 00:14:59,798
and you both realized that
you made a huge mistake.

306
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:02,951
And that's why you spent your
first night living with Robin

307
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:04,604
out playing laser tag with me.

308
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,929
And that's why
three seconds ago

309
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:10,586
you didn't call it "my place"
or "our place" or "home,"

310
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:12,579
you called it "Robin's."

311
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,806
You know what?

312
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:18,608
You can keep my stuff.

313
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:24,116
- Hey.
- Hey, did you get the truck back?

314
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,188
No.

315
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:26,710
Why not? What happened?

316
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:29,977
Oh, he pissed me off so much,
I left.

317
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:33,784
Anyway, I just wanted to come back here,
space out and watch a movie.

318
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,569
Do you anything that
wasn't made by John Woo?

319
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,532
Why, do you?

320
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,430
You know, forget the movie.
I just want to sit.

321
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:48,729
What?

322
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:51,160
It's just I eat at that table.

323
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:53,604
Fine, I'll take my shoes off.

324
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,710
You know, why don't you just
throw me down in the storage space

325
00:15:55,744 --> 00:15:56,910
where you have room for me.

326
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:58,765
- Ted, come on.
- No, you come on.

327
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:00,999
I had to jump through
hoops all night for Barney

328
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:02,822
and then it took me an hour
to get home because his place

329
00:16:02,857 --> 00:16:04,742
is so far away from the bar.

330
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,267
- Oh, my God.
- What?

331
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:09,733
I know where Barney
put my truck.

332
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:15,663
Let's go back to my place.

333
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:18,585
I bet you my place is closer.

334
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:22,501
Here we are.

335
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:25,045
You live in the loading
dock behind the bar?

336
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:28,161
I don't live here, baby.
This is just my ride.

337
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:32,709
No, no, no, no.
I'm not getting into any van,

338
00:16:32,763 --> 00:16:34,712
I've seen Silence of the Lambs.

339
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:48,857
Oh, my God. We're drinking champagne
in the back of a moving van.

340
00:16:48,912 --> 00:16:51,151
Why, yes, Sara. Yes, we are.

341
00:16:51,205 --> 00:16:55,287
Those other Rockettes who
called you slow are crazy.

342
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:09,920
Oh, my God. I knew it.
You're kidnapping me.

343
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:11,603
- Help! Help!
- No, no, no, no.

344
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:13,114
I can explain.

345
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:19,847
Hello?

346
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:21,861
Enjoying the ride?

347
00:17:21,914 --> 00:17:25,086
Ted? Ted, you let us out of here.
You let us out of here this instant!

348
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:26,687
This isn't Ted.

349
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:29,212
But I hear that guy's awesome.

350
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:38,576
So I took Sara home and I took
Barney to a bar near his apartment.

351
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:41,001
Apparently, that strategy
had never occurred to him.

352
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:43,375
That poor girl must've
been so confused.

353
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,466
Yeah.

354
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,119
Well, at least Barney
learned a valuable lesson.

355
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:49,545
You do not want to get scissor
kicked in the groin by a Rockette.

356
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:57,186
So, uh,
I guess we should get you unpacked.

357
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:58,460
Yeah.

358
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,473
Yeah, I guess we should.

359
00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:06,393
Lily... deep within the
Amazonian rainforest,

360
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:10,327
there is a type of tree that only grows
around the body of an existing tree.

361
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:13,494
It cannot survive
without this tree.

362
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:15,719
It is supported...

363
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:17,352
by this tree.

364
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:20,497
Lily, we are that tree.

365
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,449
- The inside tree or the outside tree?
- The outside tree.

366
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:25,765
- Shouldn't there be three trees?
- You and I are one tree.

367
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:29,210
Okay, look, Lily,
the point is that we grew around Ted

368
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:31,553
and without him,
we're slowly dying.

369
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:34,368
What do we do?

370
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:38,927
I think we can
marry each other.

371
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:42,251
But we also have to marry Ted.

372
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:46,648
I'll tell you right now, my Dad is
not gonna pay for that wedding.

373
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,671
Ted!

374
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,346
What are you doing here?

375
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,420
Robin and I aren't gonna
move in together after all.

376
00:18:53,473 --> 00:18:54,953
What happened?

377
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,186
I thought we decided
we were ready?

378
00:18:58,244 --> 00:18:59,638
I know.

379
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:01,594
How did we come to that again?

380
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:04,887
I don't remember.
We were fighting?

381
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:07,133
- It's all so blurry.
- Yeah.

382
00:19:07,388 --> 00:19:09,917
The "let's move in together"
sex was pretty amazing.

383
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:10,936
I know.

384
00:19:10,993 --> 00:19:14,134
I did that thing with no hands
I normally need both to do.

385
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:19,480
You know...
I'm really happy with you.

386
00:19:19,537 --> 00:19:22,376
I really happy with you.
The way things are.

387
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:24,189
Maybe we shouldn't
mess with that.

388
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:25,991
I don't know that we should.

389
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:35,619
Hey... I hear the "let's not move in
together" sex is pretty incredible.

390
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:38,504
Let's go back to my place.

391
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:51,404
- Ooh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

392
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,289
- No, thank you.
- You'll be very happy.

393
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:59,897
Look, I know you guys are really excited
about having the place to yourself.

394
00:20:00,052 --> 00:20:03,766
Until after the wedding, I mean,
if it's not too much of an imposition...

395
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:11,125
God, this feels so right.

396
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:13,380
Never leave us again.

397
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,991
Guys, Robin's down in the truck and
there's actually a lot of boxes,

398
00:20:19,024 --> 00:20:20,480
so maybe we should...

399
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,387
Do we have time for this?

400
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:30,120
Ladies and gentlemen, I have in my
hand a copy of tonight's Top Ten list.

401
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:33,527
The category: top ten things
I would've called my truck...

402
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,419
It was never your truck.

403
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:37,071
...if Ted hadn't been a
jerk and given it back.

404
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:38,155
It was a rental.

405
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,099
Number ten, "The Winne-Bango."

406
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:44,416
Number nine,
"The Pick-Up Truck."

407
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:47,712
Number eight,
"The Ford Explore Her."

408
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:51,916
Number seven,
"The You Scream Truck."

409
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:54,663
You Scream.

410
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:58,870
Number six,
"Feels On Wheels." Hello!

411
00:20:58,922 --> 00:21:02,024
Number five,
"The Ride Her Truck."

412
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:04,909
Number four, "The 18-Squeeler."

413
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:08,735
Number three, "The Esca-Laid."

414
00:21:11,385 --> 00:21:14,664
Number two, "The Slam-Boney."

415
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,447
and... the number one thing
I would've called my truck

416
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:19,753
if Ted hadn't been a jerk
and given it back...

417
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:22,307
"The '69 Chevy."

418
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:27,966
Sorry.
