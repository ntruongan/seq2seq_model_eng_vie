1
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:04,967
Kids, as you know, Christmas is a
time you spend with your family.

2
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:07,795
So in December of 2006,
I had three options.

3
00:00:07,805 --> 00:00:10,628
Spend it with my mom and
her new boyfriend Clint,

4
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,199
spend it with my dad and his
new girlfriend micro-brewing,

5
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:16,409
or head down to Staten
Island to spend it

6
00:00:16,419 --> 00:00:19,611
with my super religious
cousin Stacy and her family.

7
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,750
So I opted for
none of the above

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,673
and decided to spend
Christmas 2006 in Manhattan...

9
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:28,894
celebrating with
my other family.

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,575
Okay, I have one last paper
due at 5:00 p.m. today,

11
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:37,046
so until then,
I will be at the law library at school,

12
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:38,728
but I'm not to be
disturbed for any reason.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,726
Dude, open your eyes.
You're going to hurt yourself.

14
00:00:40,758 --> 00:00:43,813
No, no. Christmas Eve winter
wonderland is my reward

15
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:45,423
for finishing my paper.

16
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:48,874
Baby, do I smell your
Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?

17
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:50,005
Yes.

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,469
Damn me and my
heightened other senses.

19
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:53,836
Must be strong.

20
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,181
Okay, I'll be back
here at 5:00.

21
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:59,371
Save me at least 20 cookies
and do not clean the bowl.

22
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:03,563
Was that a reindeer?

23
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:04,813
I don't want to know!

24
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,288
Hey, look.
Our old answering machine.

25
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:14,828
Oh, yeah. After you left,
we, uh, we unplugged it

26
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:18,140
because it reminded Marshall of how
you used to, you know, leave messages.

27
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:20,583
But hey,
you guys are back together.

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,234
I say we're plugging
it back in.

29
00:01:25,022 --> 00:01:26,405
It's good to have you back.

30
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:27,627
Thanks.

31
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:30,610
Oh, hey, look,
there's still some messages on here.

32
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:33,230
Hey Ted,
it's Dad calling to check in.

33
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:35,602
I'm going fishing this
weekend with my friend Clint,

34
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:39,185
so if I don't hear from you beforehand,
I'll talk to you next week.

35
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,945
Yes, same Clint.

36
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:45,148
Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the
couch right now moping about Lily?

37
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,658
You are, aren't you?

38
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,970
Well, stop it.
She's not worth it.

39
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:50,940
You gotta get over that Grinch.

40
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:53,452
But I didn't say "Grinch."

41
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:55,273
I said a bad word.

42
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,766
A very, very bad word.

43
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:01,308
Oh, fudge.

44
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:03,276
But I didn't say fudge.

45
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:06,344
Sync by vNaru

46
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:23,771
I'm... a what?

47
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,420
I-- That was Barney,
that was Barney.

48
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,223
- That was you, Ted.
- That was Marshall.

49
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:30,354
Marshall left a
message for Marshall?

50
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:35,164
You know, it may have been me,
but it was so long ago.

51
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,609
Man, that machine,
it really garbles your voice.

52
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:39,938
You know, it almost
made it sound like I said...

53
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:41,861
Why would you call me that?

54
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,570
It was a fair question.

55
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:46,403
Marshall's breakup with Lily had
sent him into a deep depression

56
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,034
and nothing could
get him out of it.

57
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:49,904
Until one day...

58
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,766
She was perfect.

59
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,688
I lost the perfect woman.

60
00:02:55,332 --> 00:02:57,889
I should have knocked her
up when I had the chance.

61
00:02:57,903 --> 00:02:59,668
Okay. That's it.

62
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:03,261
You're never going to get over her until
you stop putting her on a pedestal.

63
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:07,236
So no more ice cream until you tell
me one thing that's wrong with Lily.

64
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,307
There's only one of her?

65
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:11,607
Okay.

66
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,998
She called off your wedding

67
00:03:13,014 --> 00:03:15,619
and dumped you to be a
painter in San Francisco.

68
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:17,028
What do you call that?

69
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:19,291
Fiercely independent?

70
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,444
Brave?

71
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,925
I guess it was a
little selfish.

72
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:27,617
There you go.

73
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:32,337
And in almost no time,
that spark turned into a roaring fire.

74
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:34,881
Yeah. No, you're right.
Lily would laugh at anything.

75
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:36,580
She'd give it up for a bad pun.

76
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:38,612
I'm telling you,
she's a laugh slut.

77
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:40,482
Remember that time we
heard her laughing

78
00:03:40,498 --> 00:03:42,213
and we thought she was
watching Weekend At Bernie's,

79
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:45,277
but it turned out she was
watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?

80
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:46,977
And her art?

81
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,978
"I'm Lily, I'm an artist."

82
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:50,698
She doesn't even own a beret.

83
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:53,241
Yeah, and if she's
such a great "artist,"

84
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:55,280
why does she suck
at Pictionary?

85
00:03:55,297 --> 00:03:58,412
Who draws a ninja star like a
Star of David? Right, right?

86
00:03:58,428 --> 00:03:59,474
Yeah!

87
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,666
- Another round!
- Yeah!

88
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,235
I was trying to help him.
I'm his best friend.

89
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:06,097
That's the best friend's job.

90
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:09,489
The best friend's job is
to call me that word?

91
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:11,052
Yeah.

92
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:13,304
Oh, Ted.

93
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:14,963
Oh, Teddy boy.

94
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,763
Why is this such a big deal?
It's just a word.

95
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,794
We use lots of words,
every day.

96
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,906
It shouldn't be any different
than any other word.

97
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:23,699
Then why don't you say it now?

98
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,287
Grinch.

99
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:29,081
You timed that didn't you?

100
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:30,453
Perfectly.

101
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:32,544
Well, at least you apologized.

102
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,146
You apologized, didn't you?

103
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,257
Oh, yeah.

104
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:38,787
"I'm sorry" were the first
words out of my mouth.

105
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:41,427
I'm sorry,
but I am not apologizing.

106
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:43,540
I was just trying to put
the guy back together.

107
00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:44,811
You smashed him to pieces.

108
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,701
Are you seriously not going to
apologize for leaving that message?

109
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:48,721
- No!
- Why not?

110
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:51,213
Because, Lily, this summer,
you were kind of a Grinch.

111
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:52,746
- Oooh.
- Oooh.

112
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:56,617
Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby.

113
00:04:57,582 --> 00:04:59,667
Ted Vivian Mosby!

114
00:04:59,684 --> 00:05:00,950
That's not my middle name.

115
00:00:00,443 --> 00:00:00,438
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:02,015
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

116
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,682
Like you've never
said that word.

117
00:05:04,768 --> 00:05:06,793
I don't kiss your
mother with my mouth.

118
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,964
Yet.

119
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,744
Are you sick?

120
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,817
Is it sick to find maturity
and experience sexy?

121
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,516
No, I meant do you have a cold?

122
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:16,828
I'm fine.

123
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:24,872
I'm fine. My nose
is just overflowing with awesome

124
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:26,524
and I had to get
some of it out.

125
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,725
Now, if you'll excuse me,
the holidays are a time

126
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:31,929
when people are
lonely and desperate.

127
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:34,790
It's the most wonderful
time of the year.

128
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:39,601
I should go apologize.
It's Christmas Eve.

129
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:43,853
Yeah. I mean,
slamming doors and screaming curses?

130
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:46,424
If I wanted that, I would
have gone home for the holidays.

131
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:52,200
I don't see any
mistletoe, but...

132
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:56,269
Oh! Oh, God!

133
00:05:57,268 --> 00:06:00,072
Uh... "Bless you"
would have been nice.

134
00:06:01,638 --> 00:06:03,073
- You're sick.
- I'm not sick.

135
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,687
- You're sick.
- You know what? I am sick.

136
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,549
Sick of you telling me I'm sick.
What up?

137
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:18,182
Ahh... Three flights of stairs,
not a drop spilled.

138
00:06:18,197 --> 00:06:19,435
Hey, buddy.

139
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:22,197
You sure this is gonna work?

140
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:23,316
Yeah, this is our thing.

141
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,748
In college, whenever I wanted to make
up with her, I'd buy her a beer.

142
00:06:25,783 --> 00:06:27,440
- Cute, right?
- Totally.

143
00:06:27,464 --> 00:06:28,659
Plus free mug.

144
00:06:29,746 --> 00:06:31,500
Okay, come on.

145
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:33,980
Usually that would've
done the trick,

146
00:06:33,987 --> 00:06:37,823
but it turned out this was a problem
not even alcohol could solve.

147
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:47,366
Actually the beer
helped a little.

148
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,713
She took the decorations.

149
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:56,317
She took the decorations!

150
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,596
What a Grinch!

151
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,619
That time I did say "Grinch."

152
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:00,639
All right.

153
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,459
I guess I have to
call her, right?

154
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:05,659
Lily's cell phone.

155
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,833
She'll listen to
reason-- right?

156
00:07:09,186 --> 00:07:10,762
Oh, hey, Billy.

157
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,825
Actually, funny thing--
the voice dial got you.

158
00:07:13,842 --> 00:07:15,097
I was trying to call...

159
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:18,166
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

160
00:07:18,794 --> 00:07:22,082
Yeah, the holidays are a rough
time for everyone, Billy.

161
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:25,564
Okay, yeah,
dinner next Wednesday.

162
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:27,011
Okay.

163
00:07:27,557 --> 00:07:29,273
Damn voice dial.

164
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:35,229
Barney! What the
hell are you doing?

165
00:07:35,243 --> 00:07:38,379
Get in here, it's freezing outside.
Are you insane?

166
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:43,114
Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive
"no cigars in the apartment rule."

167
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,524
God, it's like Marshall's
marrying the Taliban.

168
00:07:46,357 --> 00:07:47,335
High five.

169
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,805
Eww. No.

170
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:51,387
You have to go home
and get to bed.

171
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:56,101
Oh, Robin, my simple friend
from the untamed north,

172
00:07:56,766 --> 00:08:01,524
let me tell you about a little
thing I like to call mind over body.

173
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:04,596
You see,
whenever I start feeling sick,

174
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:08,096
I just stop being sick
and be awesome instead.

175
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:09,649
True story.

176
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:12,569
Yeah, in two minutes,

177
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:17,022
I'm going to pound a sixer
of Red Bull, hop in a cab,

178
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:19,343
play a couple of
hours of laser tag,

179
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:22,705
maybe get a spray-on tan.

180
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,805
It's gonna be legen...

181
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,657
Wait for it...

182
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:32,259
Lily!

183
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:34,193
Merry Christmas, assface.

184
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:37,573
Um, Lily?
Where are the Christmas decorations?

185
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,335
At my apartment.

186
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,165
You want to bring them back so we can
celebrate Christmas together-- please?

187
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,086
Ted, do you know
what I would do

188
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:47,709
if one of my kindergartners
used that kind of language?

189
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:49,972
I would be on the phone
with their parents.

190
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,921
Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.

191
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:54,042
Exactly. You know
what that word means.

192
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:57,185
You know that calling people
names is mean and hurtful...

193
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:58,594
assface.

194
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,188
Lily, if you don't bring that
stuff back right now, we...

195
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:04,149
She hung up.

196
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:06,140
She's just mad.
She'll cool down.

197
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:09,442
Lily...

198
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:11,541
Don't forget to take the
cookies out of the oven...

199
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,712
assface!

200
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:14,726
Damn it!

201
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,387
I could be in Cleveland right now
making peppermint lager with my dad.

202
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:19,869
Where are you going?

203
00:09:19,914 --> 00:09:21,450
Marshall gets home
in three hours.

204
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:24,772
He's gonna show up--
no Lily, no winter wonderland.

205
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:26,690
I gotta get up to the Bronx.

206
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:29,824
...dary.

207
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,627
Hey, dude,
how's the paper going?

208
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,409
Screw the paper, how's the winter
wonderland? Is it magical?

209
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:40,148
Oh... so magical.

210
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:41,578
When you walk through the door,
does it feel like

211
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:44,301
you've been slapped in
the face by Christmas?

212
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,164
Sure does. Look, I gotta go.

213
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,575
Come on, man, describe it!
Tell me about the decorations.

214
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,566
Is Rudolph there?
He is, isn't he?

215
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,315
Hi, Rudolph!

216
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,779
Ah, yeah, but, you know...

217
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,198
decorations, is that really
what Christmas is about?

218
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:58,881
Hell, yeah!
What else would it be about?

219
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:01,401
Uh, try the birth of Christ.

220
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:04,882
You know, Christmas--
Christ Mas,

221
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,027
which means "More Christ"
to our Spanish friends.

222
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,667
Yeah, well,
all I know is walking in that door

223
00:10:10,683 --> 00:10:14,780
and seeing the winter wonderland
and seeing Lily and all you guys,

224
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,760
just... I can't wait.

225
00:10:16,776 --> 00:10:18,683
Right. I gotta go.

226
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:19,752
Right. Okay.

227
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:21,404
Oh, wait. Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted.
One more thing.

228
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:23,685
How about the cookies?
Are they delicious?

229
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,377
You know, honestly,
they taste a little store-bought.

230
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:32,641
Oh! I got another call.

231
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:34,382
Well, tell Lily I love her.

232
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:35,349
Right.

233
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:38,771
- Hello?
- Ted Evelyn Mosby!

234
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:41,124
Oh. Uh, hey, Mom.
Merry Christmas.

235
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:44,466
I just got the most
disturbing call from Lily.

236
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:47,748
How could you use
such a horrible word?

237
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:49,388
Oh, God, she called you?

238
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:51,448
Are you acting out
because of the divorce?

239
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:53,301
Is-is this all about Clint?

240
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:55,343
No, Mom,
why would it be about Clint?

241
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:58,846
Hey, buddy, it's Clint.
How you doing, champ?

242
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,335
Hey, Clint. Listen, um,
I don't really have time to...

243
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:03,827
Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted.

244
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,017
You don't know this yet,

245
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:07,721
but you and I are going
to be great friends.

246
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:10,562
Now, the Native Americans
have this ritual...

247
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:21,747
This is a low moment
for the Barnacle.

248
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:25,488
I should be off playing
laser tag right now,

249
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:27,019
but instead...

250
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:30,124
Don't look at me. I'm hideous.

251
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:32,422
You just look like
a regular guy.

252
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,544
Exactly.

253
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,546
I'm a Ted.
I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants.

254
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:39,608
And isn't it more comfy?

255
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:40,970
Yes.

256
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:43,828
Come on,
you need eat something.

257
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:48,812
Too weak... to hold... bowl.

258
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,043
Fine, I'll feed you.

259
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:59,617
Ouchie in my mouth!

260
00:12:03,758 --> 00:12:06,202
I don't want it.
I want ice cream.

261
00:12:06,218 --> 00:12:09,074
No, you're not having ice cream
for dinner just 'cause you're sick.

262
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:10,786
- But my throat hurts.
- No.

263
00:12:10,802 --> 00:12:12,276
I hate you!

264
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,715
Don't leave me.

265
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,467
Who is it?

266
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:23,987
Pizza delivery.

267
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:29,251
Whoa.

268
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:31,170
Hey, you tricked me.

269
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,233
You really thought I was
the pizza delivery guy?

270
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:35,482
No, I knew it was you.

271
00:12:35,498 --> 00:12:37,927
I just thought you'd at
least bring a pizza.

272
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,334
Yeah, well,

273
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,848
I brought a beer,
but I gave it to a homeless guy.

274
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:45,738
All right, he took it from me.

275
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:47,819
Now, will you please come home?

276
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:50,813
No, I'm not spending
Christmas with you.

277
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:53,583
Okay, I'm sorry for
calling you a...

278
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:55,487
that word,

279
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:57,037
over the summer,

280
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:59,019
and for saying it again today.

281
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:01,898
And for thinking it a lot
on the subway ride over.

282
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:05,980
I had no right to say that. It was
hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.

283
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:07,574
Oh, shut up.

284
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:11,686
You think I don't know your fake
apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh?

285
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,095
You're clearly still mad at me.

286
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:15,957
- I'm not mad at you.
- Yes, you are.

287
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:18,090
I am not mad at you, Lily.
Now, can we please just...

288
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:20,510
I've apologized to Marshall
and he's forgiven me

289
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:22,560
and we've moved passed it.
Why can't you?

290
00:13:22,574 --> 00:13:25,403
Because you never
apologized to me.

291
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:27,882
Marshall's not the only
one you walked out on.

292
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:30,415
You leave for three months,
you don't even call.

293
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:32,595
Come on, Lily,
we're supposed to be friends!

294
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,556
Yeah, some friend,
you called me a Grinch.

295
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:36,860
- You were a Grinch!
- How can you...

296
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:41,550
Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch,
Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.

297
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:44,074
Happy?

298
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:46,465
Now, you've pissed off
the big guy upstairs.

299
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,664
Yeah, I'm sure
God cares if I...

300
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:51,876
You use that language again
and I'll turn off your water!

301
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:54,319
That's my super.
He lives above me.

302
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,291
Great. Thanks to
your filthy mouth,

303
00:13:56,306 --> 00:13:58,841
now I'm going to have
Christmas alone in the dark.

304
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:01,594
Fine. I don't want
to ruin Christmas.

305
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:03,576
You can have the apartment.
Don't worry about seeing me there

306
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:05,555
I'll be in Staten Island
with my cousin Stacy.

307
00:14:05,571 --> 00:14:06,604
Just....

308
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,527
Ow.

309
00:14:14,517 --> 00:14:16,193
Merry Christmas.

310
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:19,512
You're spending Christmas
Eve with your family?

311
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:22,136
Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.

312
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:24,875
Uh, they're fine. They're just...
they're a little weird.

313
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,319
You know they don't believe
in gifts or Christmas trees.

314
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,627
And they think Santa's
how Satan spells his name

315
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:31,532
when he wants to trick us.

316
00:14:31,924 --> 00:14:33,580
Well, do you want
me to go with you?

317
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:34,892
Was that a sincere offer?

318
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,712
First tell me your answer.

319
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:38,446
Stay there. Save yourself.

320
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,894
We'll spend all day
together tomorrow.

321
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:40,747
Okay.

322
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:41,988
Oh, how's Barney feeling?

323
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,838
You mean the whiney
bottomless pit of neediness?

324
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:48,689
He was bugging me, so I spiked
his echinacea tea with codeine.

325
00:14:50,444 --> 00:14:52,644
You're gonna be a great mom.

326
00:14:56,748 --> 00:15:01,689
Holy crap, the magical
Christmas season is upon us.

327
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:04,839
And thank God we don't
pay for utilities.

328
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:06,311
Merry Christmas!

329
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:07,941
What's in the box?

330
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:12,244
Only the best present
for the best girl ever.

331
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,814
It took me all day
to track it down.

332
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:15,507
I thought you were
writing a paper.

333
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,506
Ah, naw, I blew that off.
I'll get an extension.

334
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:18,696
School's not important.

335
00:15:18,713 --> 00:15:22,341
What is that pitter
patter on the roof?

336
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:26,052
Could it be the sound of
an awesome Christmas story

337
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:28,203
about to come down the chimney?

338
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:30,624
Why, yes, it is.

339
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:32,994
'Twas the day
before Christmas...

340
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:35,066
It was supposed to arrive,
like, five days ago,

341
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:36,917
but then it got
lost and rerouted.

342
00:15:36,931 --> 00:15:39,350
I checked two other branches,
finally they told me it was here.

343
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:42,161
Yeah, all I needed to know
was the tracking number.

344
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:46,723
Looks like it's headed out to our
regional branch in Poughkeepsie.

345
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:47,772
What?

346
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:50,356
No, no, no, no,
I need that package today.

347
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:52,717
Listen, the truck already
left five minutes ago,

348
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:55,337
so unless you want
to run after it...

349
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:58,860
Stop! Stop!

350
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:01,302
Stop, please, stop.

351
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:03,753
Stop. Stop the truck.

352
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,796
I need a package on your truck.
Can I please take a look in back?

353
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,110
Sure. But I gotta keep
driving my route.

354
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:14,581
I'm running behind.

355
00:16:20,267 --> 00:16:21,913
My bad.

356
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,296
I'm okay.

357
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:29,577
Hey, man, thanks for helping me
make my fiancée's Christmas.

358
00:16:29,594 --> 00:16:30,759
No problem.

359
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:34,069
Too bad I can't deliver all these
packages by the end of the day.

360
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:38,364
Wait, so some people aren't going to
get their gifts in time for Christmas?

361
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:40,875
Sadly, no.

package on that truck.

00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:19,036
But I still have one
package left to give.

370
00:17:19,283 --> 00:17:20,705
Yeah, I did.

371
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:23,497
Merry Christmas.

372
00:17:24,073 --> 00:17:25,801
- Open it, Baby.
- Okay.

373
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,351
Oh, my God.

374
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:31,905
An Easy Bake Oven!

375
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:34,905
I've wanted one of these ever
since I was a little girl.

376
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:37,117
In this exact model.

377
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:40,600
I never told you that.
How did you know?

378
00:17:41,183 --> 00:17:43,471
It's our first Christmas
since we got back together.

379
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:45,151
I want to get her
something really special.

380
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,940
So I'm getting her a jukebox.

381
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,042
Wow, that's a great gift.

382
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,786
Not really.
It's this big and it dispenses gum.

383
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,098
Oh, man, I know
something you could get her

384
00:17:56,113 --> 00:17:58,618
that would blow her mind.

385
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:00,721
Ready?

386
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:02,440
Eight years ago...

387
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:08,615
When I was a kid,
all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven.

388
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,237
I begged and I begged,

389
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,199
but all I got was a stupid Lego set
because my feminist mom

390
00:18:14,214 --> 00:18:18,229
didn't want me conforming to
traditional gender roles.

391
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,244
Easy Bake Oven--
that's what I'm going to call my van.

392
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,485
Dude... how was the concert?

393
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,348
I couldn't find the outside.

394
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:41,294
I can't believe Ted remembered
after all these years.

395
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:43,663
Yeah, and after all that weed.

396
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:46,054
Where is he anyway?

397
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,297
Staten Island.

398
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:50,268
Why?

399
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:57,784
Okay, don't tell your mom,
but I got you guys some presents.

400
00:18:57,796 --> 00:19:00,103
Like the gift
of God's love?

401
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:02,116
No, dude, real presents.

402
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,837
Uncle Ted got us presents!

403
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:09,798
That's okay, Ted,
we'll just give them to charity.

404
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:10,818
Yay!

405
00:19:10,835 --> 00:19:12,631
Uh, not you, Charity.

406
00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:14,924
I meant the less fortunate.

407
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:18,825
Ted, how would you like
to say grace tonight?

408
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,954
Uh, you know what,
why don't you say it.

409
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:22,568
I really wouldn't
know what to say.

410
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,747
Why don't you recite your
favorite passage of scripture.

411
00:19:25,802 --> 00:19:28,219
That's a great idea, Charity.

412
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,532
But, really, I don't know.

413
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:31,800
I mean how do you choose
your favorite passage?

414
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:35,965
It's the Bible; there's so many...
great ones...

415
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,386
That one from Pulp
Fiction's pretty cool.

416
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:40,978
Ooh, I'll get it.
Charity, I'm tapping you in.

417
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:43,628
Dear, Father,
thank you for this day,

418
00:19:43,643 --> 00:19:46,341
and thank you for bringing
this family together.

419
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:47,681
Amen.

420
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:49,242
Who is it, Ted?

421
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:53,515
Uh, it's...
it's just, um, carolers.

423

424
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:08,634
I came here to apologize.

425
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:09,813
I'm so sorry, Ted.

426
00:20:09,828 --> 00:20:11,694
I accept. Give me the beer.

427
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:18,288
Oh, oh,
it is so good to see you guys.

428
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,959
Are you coming home?

429
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:22,660
Totally.

430
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,572
But first, Lily,
I owe you an apology.

431
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:27,632
Oh, for the love of God,
are you as sick of apologies as I am?

432
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:28,425
Yes!

433
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:31,317
Can we just skip the apology and
go straight to the forgiving?

434
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:32,507
Yes.

435
00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:36,759
And I promise, I will never ever
call you a... you know, again.

436
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:37,899
That's okay.

437
00:20:37,913 --> 00:20:39,731
I was kind of a Grinch.

438
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:41,711
What's a Grinch?

439
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:46,013
Nothing. It's something
you shouldn't say.

440
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:48,605
Mom, what's a Grinch?

441
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,377
Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...

442
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:57,022
Merry Christmas, everybody.

443
00:20:58,336 --> 00:20:59,942
Run, run.

444
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,967
Merry Christmas, Marshall.
