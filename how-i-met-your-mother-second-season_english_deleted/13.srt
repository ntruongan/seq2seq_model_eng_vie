1
00:00:01,218 --> 00:00:03,440
Some kids dream of
being astronauts.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,630
Some kids dream of
playing baseball.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,171
When I was a kid,
I had only one dream.

4
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:09,760
To build a skyscraper.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,737
That's stupid.

6
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:15,280
There were some
obstacles along the way.

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,679
But eventually my
dream came true.

8
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:20,301
I became an architect.

9
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,679
Morning, everyone!

10
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:26,556
So, I had an idea
for the atrium.

11
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:27,986
Ready?

12
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,037
Columns.

13
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:32,415
That's stupid.

14
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:38,247
Sync by vNaru

15
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:55,505
I... I can't believe you
knocked over my model.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,565
Well, it's just...
it's not exactly new, is it-- columns?

17
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:02,806
I mean, what's your next
groundbreaking idea-- ceilings?

18
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:04,387
Floors?

19
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:06,189
Windows?

20
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,959
I know what you're thinking:
Who's this jerk?

21
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:11,509
Well, this jerk was
Hammond Druthers,

22
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:13,840
a legend in the
architecture community.

23
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:15,698
Very big in the '80s.

24
00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:19,442
He was also far and away
the worst boss I ever had.

25
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,970
Then I designed the Spokane
National Bank Building.

26
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:25,443
And suddenly... I was his boss.

27
00:01:25,488 --> 00:01:27,943
- And he didn't like it.
- Stairs?

28
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,241
And to be honest,
I wasn't sure I liked it either.

29
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:34,235
See, before,
when I was just another employee,

30
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,776
I was happy, carefree.

31
00:01:36,788 --> 00:01:39,616
The guy who hung out in the break
room making fun of the boss.

32
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,684
Did you see what he
was wearing today?

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,474
It was like his pants were
being held up by his nipples.

34
00:01:45,803 --> 00:01:49,117
Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers,
I get hay fever just looking at it.

35
00:01:51,522 --> 00:01:53,669
But suddenly I was
a different guy.

36
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,277
Hey, guys.

37
00:01:56,775 --> 00:01:58,220
What's so funny?

38
00:01:58,324 --> 00:01:59,420
Nothing.

39
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:02,401
Um... nice shirt.

40
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:04,112
Thanks.

41
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,820
The hours were insane.

42
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:09,002
I was always working even
when I wasn't at work.

43
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:12,403
Oh, Robin...
I just had a great idea.

44
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,144
Oh, do whatever you want to
me just don't wake me up.

45
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,786
Before, I used to be this guy.

46
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:25,104
Dude, of course you should take the
day off for the Foo Fighters concert.

47
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,355
Just say you're sick.

48
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:27,485
But now...

49
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,836
I was this guy.

50
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:30,225
Sick, huh?

51
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:33,547
Unbutton your shirt.

52
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:38,089
Hmm... "Foo Fighters."

53
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:41,047
Get back to work.

54
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:44,451
But still,
the worst part was Druthers.

55
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:46,672
- Well, I was thinking...
- Ceilings? Oops.

56
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:51,421
Said that already. Then again,
you seem to like rehashing old ideas.

57
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,122
I'm kidding, of course.

58
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:56,081
Another hole in one, boss.

59
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,655
Oh, wow,
he must be really good-looking.

60
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,743
Why would you say that?

61
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:03,714
Well, 'cause only good-looking people
can get away with saying things like that.

62
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,166
I have found that to be true.

63
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:07,136
It's a blessing
and a curse really.

64
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,026
Ted, you can't let him
treat you like that.

65
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,286
Yeah, you gotta ask yourself,
who's the boss?

66
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,307
- Tony.
- Angela.   - Mona.

67
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,566
Mona?

68
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,086
Watch it more closely.
Rock your world.

69
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:20,116
So, what are you gonna do?

70
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:23,437
Well... it's awkward, I mean,
the guy used to be my boss.

71
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,601
So, I went to talk to
the managing partner.

72
00:03:25,616 --> 00:03:26,959
Fire him.

73
00:03:27,363 --> 00:03:30,429
Well, sir, I was thinking he could
just be put on a different project.

74
00:03:30,446 --> 00:03:31,739
Fire him!

75
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:35,423
He's an arrogant,
washed-up, pain in the ass.

76
00:03:35,435 --> 00:03:38,252
In fact,
fire everyone on that project.

77
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:41,502
Druthers, Mosby,
the whole lot of them.

78
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:44,903
Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear
Mosby's doing some great work.

79
00:03:44,918 --> 00:03:49,644
Fine, Mosby can stay.
But tell him he's on thin ice.

80
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:53,016
Come here.

81
00:03:54,982 --> 00:03:57,538
I like you, Crosby.

82
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,519
You mind if I charge my phone?

83
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,836
Knock yourself out.

84
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:05,440
Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers,
the key is timing.

85
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,860
Remember when I had to
fire my makeup artist?

86
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:11,789
Vicki, um...
I'm so sorry about this,

87
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:14,991
but there's been some
budget cuts and, um,

88
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,830
we have to let you go.

89
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,050
I mean, after tonight.

90
00:04:19,078 --> 00:04:21,693
I still need my makeup
for the broadcast.

91
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:23,664
So...

92
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:29,344
Our thoughts and prayers go out
to the families of the victims.

93
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:30,714
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

94
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,673
I'm gonna fire
Druthers tomorrow.

95
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:38,454
- Oh, my God!
- What?

96
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:40,717
- Do you know about this?
- No.

97
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:41,807
What is that?

98
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:44,396
Only the greatest thing ever.

99
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:47,107
Wait, wait, wait--
that's not enough buildup.

100
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:50,000
If they were to cure
cancer tomorrow,

101
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:52,669
this would still be the greatest
thing to happen all week.

102
00:04:52,686 --> 00:04:56,999
Okay. Now you're ready
for naked Marshall.

103
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,291
Oh, my God.

104
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:01,920
This is awesome times awesome.

105
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:03,501
It's awesome squared.

106
00:05:03,518 --> 00:05:06,032
I know, right?
Behind the piano this whole time.

107
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:08,413
Wait. If Marshall went to
all this trouble to hide it,

108
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:10,492
he clearly doesn't
want us to find it.

109
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,042
Oh, come on, Robin.

110
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,896
No, I'm saying that he must be
really embarrassed by this.

111
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,654
We are gonna have so much fun.

112
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,574
I know!
We're gonna have so much fun!

113
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:22,996
Oh, sorry I'm late;
lunch ran a little long.

114
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:24,427
You wanted to see me, Mosby?

115
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,857
Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.

116
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:30,426
Well, excuse me,
for spending the last four hours

117
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:33,028
drawing designs
for your building.

118
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:35,647
This is a cocktail napkin.

119
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:38,091
Covered in profanity.

120
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:41,351
Look, Hammond, um,

121
00:05:41,364 --> 00:05:44,131
there's no easy way
to say this, so...

122
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:47,890
why don't we just, um,
step into your office.

123
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:53,291
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

124
00:05:53,307 --> 00:05:57,175
- # Happy birthday to you #
- Oh, you had me. You so had me.

125
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:01,364
♪ Happy birthday, dear Hammond ♪

126
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:04,686
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

127
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:07,015
So, you didn't fire him?

128
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:10,166
I can't fire a guy on his birthday.
Everyone would hate me.

129
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:13,847
Besides, they put a party hat on me.
My authority was compromised.

130
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:17,880
Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat.

131
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,318
I know how much
you love stools.

132
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:24,640
Thanks. Yeah,
stools are better for your posture.

133
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:29,282
And, uh... I... got you a rose.

134
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:31,390
Thank you. That's so sweet.

135
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:34,331
You guys are being... so sweet.

136
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:37,673
Hey, guys. Guess what I got.
A new dart.

137
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:39,414
Oh, wow, a new dart.

138
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:41,192
Hey, that new dart is great.

139
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:43,516
I did not know you were such
a fan of new dart, Barney.

140
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,235
Oh, yes, Robin,
I just love new dart.

141
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,064
Nude art.

142
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,034
- Nude art.
- Nude art.

143
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:53,304
Okay, all right, so what,
you guys found the painting, huh?

144
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,716
I knew this day would come.

145
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:56,963
How did you know that?

146
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:58,958
Because I didn't
hide it very well.

147
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,828
So the story on the painting is that,
back in college,

148
00:07:01,842 --> 00:07:04,749
Lily wanted to do a nude
study for her art class.

149
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:06,630
Marshall wasn't
so into the idea.

150
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,679
Well, I just...
don't think that some dude

151
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,360
should drop trou just
to pose for you.

152
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:15,782
It's for class, and it's just that
weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.

153
00:07:15,798 --> 00:07:17,571
The frisbee dude
with the soul patch?

154
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:19,263
He's like the hottest
guy in school!

155
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,612
No, he's actually
a little husky...

156
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,253
Oh, he's just huggable!

157
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,865
And complicated...

158
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,734
and a little bit of a jerk.

159
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:28,415
Just enough so you think
maybe you can change him.

160
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,545
Okay, just forget it.

161
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,617
Call me old-fashioned,

162
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,406
I just think that I'm the only
guy you should see naked.

163
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,058
Well, then you'll
have to do it.

164
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:44,318
Are you kidding me?
What if somebody sees it?

165
00:07:44,343 --> 00:07:46,678
We're not in high
school anymore.

166
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:50,361
People don't make fun of you
for posing nude for a painting.

167
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,132
We're adults now.

168
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:54,151
We totally saw your butt.

169
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:00,321
This painting has caused
too much grief already.

170
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:02,031
I'm destroying it right now.

171
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,124
Oh, no,
what's the matter, Marshall?

172
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,252
Where is it?

173
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:09,715
I'll tell you where it is if
you'll answer these riddles three.

174
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,493
You hung it up in the bar,
didn't you?

175
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,224
Yo, why you gotta
ruin my riddles?

176
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:16,325
Field trip!

177
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,146
Oh, no. Someone put your
painting up behind the bar.

178
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:25,329
Classic!

179
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,287
What a memorable prank.

180
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,898
Hey, Marshall.
What'll you have?

181
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:33,891
What'll I have?
Um, I don't know, maybe a beer

182
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:36,942
and that nude painting of
me hanging behind the bar!

183
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:38,842
Ooh, I'm sorry,
that painting's property of the bar.

184
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,301
I know that Barney gave
you that painting.

185
00:08:40,335 --> 00:08:41,640
I don't know what
you're talking about.

186
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:43,100
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll pay you double.

187
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:44,103
I doubt it.

188
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:45,951
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll give you that plus ten bucks.

189
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:46,873
I doubt it.

190
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:49,505
All right, you know what, Carl, you
just lost yourself a regular customer.

191
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,062
I doubt it.

192
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:57,497
This painting is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

193
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,855
Okay, where should we put it up next?
In his law school?

194
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:04,525
Ooh on the side of a bus.
Oh, oh!

195
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,079
How much do billboards cost?

196
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:08,607
Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse.

197
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:10,967
I've got a five-year
rollout plan.

198
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:13,577
I'll have you know that painting's
got commitments all over the city.

199
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:15,219
Then, after New York...

200
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:24,763
One of my worst
fears has come true--

201
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:27,000
I just saw Marshall
grabbing himself naked.

202
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:29,382
Well, I gotta go.

203
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:31,372
Believe it or not,
I have to go back to the office.

204
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:32,832
Oh, I'll go out with you.

205
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:33,944
Bye, guys.

206
00:09:34,947 --> 00:09:38,416
You know, I wish everyone didn't
have to make fun of that painting.

207
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:40,976
Eh, we're not making fun of the painting,
we're just making fun of Marshall.

208
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,114
The painting's
actually really great.

209
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,326
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

210
00:09:45,641 --> 00:09:47,287
Well, thank you.

211
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:50,699
You know, seeing it again
makes me miss painting nudes.

212
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:54,698
What?

213
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,597
Paint me.

214
00:09:57,304 --> 00:09:58,490
What?

215
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:01,399
Paint me.

216
00:10:07,235 --> 00:10:08,513
Who's that?

217
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,130
Who's out there?

218
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:12,112
Hammond, is that you?

219
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,454
Mosby?

220
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:16,933
Druthers and I were
alone in the office.

221
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,293
If I was gonna fire him,

222
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:20,294
this would be the best
chance I'd ever have.

223
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:22,206
Uh, look, just a second, Ted.

224
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:24,317
Uh, no, I,
I really need to talk to you.

225
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,407
Look, there's no
easy way to say...

226
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:27,877
What, what are you doing?

227
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,216
What are you doing?

228
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,058
I'm standing here
wearing pants.

229
00:10:33,794 --> 00:10:36,316
Are you sleeping here?
What's going on?

230
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:37,988
Okay, fine, yes.

231
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,328
Not that it's any
of your business

232
00:10:39,364 --> 00:10:42,168
but my wife had a little
spat a few weeks ago,

233
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:45,120
and I've been sleeping
here until she cools off.

234
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:47,969
Okay, well, uh, you're right--
that is none of my business.

235
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:50,211
Uh, look,
there's no easy way to say this-- I...

236
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:51,601
Who am I kidding?

237
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:54,763
She's never gonna take me back.

238
00:11:00,498 --> 00:11:01,872
It's okay.

239
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,684
What did you want to say to me?

240
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:13,987
Happy birthday, buddy.

241
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,297
So, you've been
living at the office?

242
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:28,725
Yes.

243
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,858
I'm an architect
without a home.

244
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:34,479
You see the tragic
irony in that?

245
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:36,178
- Yeah, I do.
- 'Cause I design homes.

246
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:37,430
- I see it.
- But I don't have a home.

247
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:38,819
Not lost on me at all.

248
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,468
But I don't understand--
why don't you just go to a hotel?

249
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:44,959
You could be sleeping on
a mattress instead of...

250
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:48,203
what appears to be torn-up
drawings of my building.

251
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:50,300
Why would I go to a hotel,
when any second,

252
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:52,753
she's going to call and
tell me to come home.

253
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:57,005
She's a very special lady, Ted.

254
00:11:57,099 --> 00:12:01,346
She's quite... mannish.

255
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:03,846
She gives me what I need.

256
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,625
Do you understand that?

257
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,415
Uh, no, I don't.

258
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:11,066
If you were lost
in the wilderness,

259
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:13,446
she can provide for me.

260
00:12:14,582 --> 00:12:16,526
Well, that's the dream.

261
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:20,477
I'm glad you came
here tonight, Ted.

262
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:21,468
Me too, Hammond.

263
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:22,530
- Call me Ham.
- No, thanks.

264
00:12:22,564 --> 00:12:25,050
- Hammy D?
- No, I think just Hammond.

265
00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:28,652
So, I'm guessing
you didn't fire him.

266
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:33,270
I was this close.

267
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:36,322
Meanwhile, Lily had
been up all night

268
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:38,341
in the grips of a dilemma.

269
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,926
- Oh honey, you're awake?
- I'm awake.

270
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,887
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

271
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:56,816
I've kind of been
wrestling with something.

272
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,007
What if I told you I had a
way to pay for our honeymoon?

273
00:13:00,023 --> 00:13:01,859
Baby, our honeymoon's
already paid for.

274
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,707
We're going to Howe Caverns.

275
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:08,979
Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't
want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?

276
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:12,681
It's not just a cave,
it's a whole labyrinth of caves.

277
00:13:12,696 --> 00:13:14,601
It's an underground adventure.

278
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:17,733
There's a cave that's so dark that
you don't even know you're in there.

279
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:20,761
I mean, we're going to experience
a whole new kind of dark.

280
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:24,853
Well, what if I found a way
to make a little extra money

281
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:27,996
so that we spend our
honeymoon not in Howe Caverns,

282
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,434
but in Scotland?

283
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,505
- Loch Ness?
- Yeah.

284
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:35,546
And you know, Edinburgh and
the Highlands and Glasgow...

285
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:38,446
Loch Ness. Nessy.

286
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,987
Baby, I would love to search for the
enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch,

287
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:45,939
but... we can't afford that.

288
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,889
Maybe we can.

289
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:51,108
Paint me.

290
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:53,311
Okay, I don't get this.

291
00:13:53,324 --> 00:13:55,359
You've been making fun of
that painting all this time

292
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:57,000
and now you want
me to paint you?

293
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:59,671
We knew we could torture
Marshall because he has shame.

294
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:00,841
I do not.

295
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:03,613
In my body,
where the shame gland should be,

296
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:06,033
there's a second awesome gland.

297
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,393
True story.

298
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:10,382
Yeah, that's not the gland
I'm worried about painting.

299
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:12,015
Yeah.

300
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,773
A nude Barney is a challenge.

301
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:19,086
But I think you're talented
enough to immortalize this.

302
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,936
Now is the time-- I'm 31.

303
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,828
I'm at the peak of
my physical beauty.

304
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:29,089
If I were a woman,
I'd have passed it long, long ago.

305
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:31,347
Long ago.

306
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:32,720
Forget it.

307
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:36,219
I promised Marshall he was the
only guy I would ever see naked.

308
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:41,102
I'll give you $5,000.

309
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,642
We're going to Loch Ness!

310
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:43,812
Yeah!

311
00:14:46,357 --> 00:14:48,562
That cabby would not shut up.

312
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:50,544
Yeah, we should
call him a gabby.

313
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,884
I think it, you say it.

314
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:57,236
Hey, uh... thanks for putting
me up last night, buddy.

315
00:14:57,538 --> 00:14:58,904
Give 'em hell.

316
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:02,536
Morning, team.

317
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,265
So, I have given
it some thought,

318
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:09,379
and I say we revisit columns.

319
00:15:09,394 --> 00:15:12,030
Oh, God, not this again.

320
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:15,748
Ted, a man in a toga just arrived
and delivered a parchment.

321
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:17,190
Let me read it:

322
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:19,489
Oh! It's from ancient Greece.

323
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:22,831
They want their basic
architectural elements back.

324
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:24,872
- Geez.
- What?

325
00:15:24,897 --> 00:15:26,211
You didn't hear me?

326
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:28,072
Toga, parchment...

327
00:15:28,286 --> 00:15:30,143
Can I see you for one second?

328
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,833
Ooh, I'm in trouble now.

329
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:37,272
What are you doing?

330
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:38,835
I thought we were friends.

331
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,926
You slept on my couch,
you ate my cereal.

332
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,314
I tossed you more toilet paper.

333
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,595
We are friends.

334
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:48,655
But that doesn't magically
make your bad ideas good.

335
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:50,458
What? I don't believe this!

336
00:15:50,472 --> 00:15:52,567
You're, you're,
you're wearing my clothes!

337
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:54,618
And my
girlfriend's... sneakers--

338
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:56,828
man, you have
weirdly small feet.

339
00:15:56,882 --> 00:16:00,669
Ted, I hope that you're not going
to let our professional woes

340
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:02,648
interfere with our friendship,

341
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:05,971
because I really kind
of need you right now.

342
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:10,400
Okay, let's get this over with.

343
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,354
Hey, hey!
I don't want you phoning this in.

344
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:16,382
This painting could, someday,
become a serious work of art.

345
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:19,044
I mean, you have been
blessed with an amazing gift.

346
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:20,452
Thank you.

347
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:22,033
I meant me.

348
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,924
Now, I like how you captured
Marshall's essence.

349
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:28,265
Goofy and unburdened, with wit.

350
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,966
But me,
I want something more regal.

351
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:33,147
Something my progeny
could look at and say,

352
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:35,908
"There's stands
Barnabus Stinson."

353
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:37,627
He was wise...

354
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:39,818
and strong.

355
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:44,200
I don't think your
sword will fit.

356
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:45,900
I get that a lot.

357
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:49,210
And so, as Lily began painting,

358
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:51,141
Marshall thought
about the $5,000

359
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:53,642
and what his fiancée
was doing to earn it.

360
00:16:53,657 --> 00:16:55,350
This isn't right.

361
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:58,302
This isn't right at all.

362
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,823
Finally, he could
take it no more.

363
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:05,343
Hold still.

364
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:08,703
Hold still.

365
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:13,946
- Hold still!
- Paint faster!

366
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:18,909
Okay, I guess it's time.

367
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:21,378
Drop your shorts.

368
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:23,139
Yeah.

369
00:17:24,104 --> 00:17:25,388
Wait, wait!

370
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:28,051
That wasn't enough buildup.
I need...

371
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:31,278
In a world without justice,
one man--

372
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:33,459
- Oh, just drop them!
- All right.

373
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:39,043
- No! No, this is not right!
- We had a deal!

374
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,973
Well, I'm going back on the deal.
Barney, get out!

375
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:42,724
- You...!
- It's over!

376
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:48,904
Lily, I can't let you
go through with this!

377
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,364
I found a castle we can stay in,
but it's an extra two grand.

378
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:54,176
It's just not right!

379
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:56,844
It's beautiful and
they say it's haunted.

380
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,568
I can't let the woman I love
compromise her values for money!

381
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,537
I totally think we can get
some more money out of him.

382
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:06,227
I'm never letting my
fiancée, ever...!

383
00:18:06,243 --> 00:18:07,748
Oh, you're still here?

384
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:08,969
Before you say anything,

385
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:10,508
I'll give you an
extra five grand.

386
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,799
We accept.

387
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:15,691
You people are so
easy to control.

388
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:18,960
Dance for me, puppets, dance.

389
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:22,951
And that's how Uncle Barney paid
for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.

390
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,552
Come on, Ted, listen,
why don't we get back

391
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:28,302
and finish drawing the
plans for a building

392
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,683
which, in my opinion,
is never going to get built,

393
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,820
so you and I can get out of here
and grab a couple of beers.

394
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:34,105
No.

395
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,565
Look, Hammond,
there's no easy way to say this but...

396
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,695
Looking for Hammond Druthers.

397
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:40,546
Oh, that's me.
I'm Hammond Druthers.

398
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,298
These are divorce papers.

399
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:45,906
You've been served.

400
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:47,547
Oh, God.

401
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,439
She's really going
through with this.

402
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:53,700
So that's it. It's over.

403
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,068
There is no easy way
to say this, but...

404
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:59,251
She's giving me the
remains of Wolfie?

405
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:01,692
My dog is dead?

406
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,410
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.

407
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:07,673
She always played
too rough with him.

408
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,333
Believe me,
there is no easy way to say this--

409
00:19:11,348 --> 00:19:15,675
- # Happy birthday to you... #
- You've got to be kidding me!

410
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,513
Guys, you have no idea how much
this means to me right now.

411
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:20,085
Wait, his birthday
was yesterday!

412
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:22,337
Yeah, but a bunch of us were up
at the conference in Montreal,

413
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:25,566
- so we thought...
- No! No birthday! No!

414
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,175
I got something to say
and I'm gonna get it out.

415
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:31,209
Hammond, listen to me.
I am sorry that your dog died,

416
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:33,740
and that your wife is
divorcing you and that...

417
00:19:33,754 --> 00:19:36,230
your life is falling apart and that
these guys missed your birthday.

418
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:38,131
And there is no
easy way to say...

419
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:39,901
What are you doing?
What's going on?

420
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:41,400
Oh, God...

421
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,230
Oh, come on, you're not going
to pull that, are you?

422
00:19:44,256 --> 00:19:49,263
Oh! Look, yeah, right.
Now we're falling onto the ground.

423
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:52,342
Well, nice try, but guess what?

424
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:54,154
You're fired!

425
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,332
You're fired--
you get it? You hear me?

426
00:19:57,347 --> 00:20:00,103
You're gone! You're fired!

427
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:19,399
In my defense,
I think we all suspected Hammond

428
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:21,169
might have been faking.

429
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:26,732
On the plus side, the EMTs seem to
think he's going to be just fine

430
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:31,211
and, as you saw, they did admit that
I did not cause the heart attack,

431
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:33,772
even if they said it
a bit begrudgingly.

432
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:37,872
And there it was, rock bottom:

433
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:39,683
They all hated me.

434
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:41,763
But just when all seemed lost,

435
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:45,013
I had the greatest idea
of my entire career.

436
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:51,717
Margarita Fridays--
great idea, boss.

437
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:05,658
Okay, it's done.

438
00:21:06,402 --> 00:21:09,306
I'm gonna step out,
so you can admire it.

439
00:21:09,322 --> 00:21:11,115
Thank you very much, Lily.

440
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:16,126
Marshall, do you
have the money?

441
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,200
- Yeah.
- Let's get out of here!

442
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:21,680
A smooth area?!
You gave me the Ken doll?!

443
00:21:25,503 --> 00:21:27,810
She left out Little Barney.

444
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:30,781
Barnacle Junior.

445
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:33,770
My Barnana is...

446
00:21:35,436 --> 00:21:37,604
Barnito Supreme.
