1
00:00:00,577 --> 00:00:03,716
In May of 2007,
Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall got married

2
00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:07,144
at the historic Van Smoot
House in upstate New York.

3
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:10,596
Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.

4
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:14,002
Yeah. It's just how
I always pictured it.

5
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:15,949
Well, that was a load of crap.

6
00:00:16,203 --> 00:00:18,845
You see, kids, when you get married,
you learn a hard lesson.

7
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:22,180
The wedding you set out to have is
almost never the wedding you end up with.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,529
So, we've decided on a small,
outdoor wedding,

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,827
just family and close friends.

10
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:29,690
No more than 25 people

11
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:32,091
in a beautiful
garden somewhere,

12
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,350
maybe an acoustic
guitar playing

13
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:36,095
while we walk down the aisle.

14
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:38,839
And maybe you already know someone
who went down to the courthouse

15
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,617
and registered as an officiant

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,625
so that he or she-- he--

17
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,269
could perform the ceremony.

18
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,252
But you hate marriage.
Why do you want to perform the ceremony?

19
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,709
Because it subtly implants in
the mind of every woman there

20
00:00:50,813 --> 00:00:52,104
that when I ask a question,

21
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,691
you say, "I do."

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Yeah.

23
00:00:56,897 --> 00:00:58,309
The closer you get
to the big day,

24
00:00:58,414 --> 00:00:59,643
the more concessions you make.

25
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:02,976
Great. Now my mom's making
me invite the Lessners.

26
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:06,118
This puts our numbers
in the triple digits.

27
00:01:06,225 --> 00:01:11,172
Wow. I guess sometimes,
Lessner is more... ner.

28
00:01:11,857 --> 00:01:13,772
You know how like
sometimes less is more.

29
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,021
Yeah. This is one of
those times, sweetie?

30
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:20,478
You know what? That's okay.
It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.

31
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,681
So it's not going to be an
outdoor wedding anymore.

32
00:01:23,786 --> 00:01:27,726
Marshall's dad is convinced if we
have an outdoor wedding in New York,

33
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:31,361
he's going to get mugged,
so it's going to be inside now.

34
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:36,040
It'll be great. We're still going
to have our acoustic guitar player.

35
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:38,808
So now,
instead of an acoustic guitar,

36
00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:40,666
we're having a harp player.

37
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,062
Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and...
that guy's daughter plays the harp.

38
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:48,292
Is she hot? I'd love to be able to
cross "harp player" off my list.

39
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,329
How long is this list?

40
00:01:50,436 --> 00:01:53,582
Dude, I'm not gonna count
how many pages the list is.

41
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,056
I'm not crass.

44
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,799
Sync by vNaru

45
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:19,076
So the day arrives for Lily and
Marshall's very big indoor wedding...

46
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:20,494
with a harp.

47
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:21,717
Hi, Lily.

48
00:02:21,844 --> 00:02:23,598
Wow. Andrea.

49
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:25,142
You really are pregnant.

50
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:25,967
Yeah.

51
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:28,485
How do you play the harp
with your belly so...?

52
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:31,349
Oh, I don't really--
I can only reach about half the strings.

53
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,606
You only play half the harp?

54
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:34,783
Yeah.

55
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:37,945
Oh, no. Uh, okay.
Lily, I will take care of this.

56
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:40,704
Um, I'll just pluck the other half.
Is it hard to learn?

57
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,834
I've been studying
the harp for 12 years.

58
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:44,704
Yeah, but I'm a fast learner.

59
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:47,324
You ever hear of "Guitar Hero"?
Learned that in a day.

60
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:48,677
Is there a "Harp Hero"?

61
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:50,155
Robin, it's fine.

62
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,345
So, so, when are you due?

63
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:53,268
Tuesday.

64
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,583
Wow, that's soon.

65
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:56,017
Last Tuesday.

66
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,258
Holy crap, we have to fire her.

67
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:02,236
She's gonna drop a shorty in
the middle of your ceremony.

68
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:05,144
Robin, I'm not going
to freak myself out.

69
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:06,586
I hate those women who say,

70
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:09,006
"Oh, my wedding
has to be perfect."

71
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:12,914
Things go wrong. Sometimes the
deejay screws up your playlist.

72
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:16,677
Sometimes you slip on placenta
during the recessional.

73
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:19,250
Can I grab a scotch
and soda real quick?

74
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,802
No. I'm not allowed to serve
anything until the reception.

75
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:25,381
Wow. You just cost
yourself a big tip, buddy.

76
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:27,972
I'm not allowed to
accept tips, buddy.

77
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:30,405
You allowed to
accept criticism?

78
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,638
You, sir, are an ass... buddy.

79
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,143
Hey, you want to know what line
doesn't work on a harp player?

80
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,172
"Hey, baby, want to pluck?"

81
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:42,161
Really? That didn't work.

82
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,546
Not even a little.

83
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,881
Hey! Who's Bill?

84
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:47,796
Bill?

85
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:50,574
Yeah. This guy came
up to me at the bar.

86
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,351
Can I ask you something?

87
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:56,750
Where in the ceremony is the place
where they ask if anyone objects?

88
00:03:57,216 --> 00:03:59,803
Uh... Don't think
they do that anymore.

89
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,734
Oh, so when do you think
someone should do it?

90
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,796
Just wait for a lull or what?

91
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,904
Oh, no.

92
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:12,184
Did he look like a guy who tried
to be an umpire but failed?

93
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:14,289
He kind of did.

94
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:15,634
That's Scooter.

95
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,142
Your high school
boyfriend, Scooter?

96
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:19,782
His real name is Bill.

97
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:21,425
My mom must have invited him.

98
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:22,942
Why? Why would she do that?

99
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:24,720
Our families are really close.

100
00:04:24,826 --> 00:04:26,156
But my ex-boyfriend?

101
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:27,502
Come on, Mom.

102
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:31,497
I didn't invite that professional
squash player Dad busted you with.

103
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:33,776
Oh, I need a glass of wine.

104
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:34,669
I'll get it.

105
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,769
Oh, thanks.
Hey, how's Marshall doing?

106
00:04:36,873 --> 00:04:37,470
He's great.

107
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:38,738
He's about to get his hair cut.

108
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,689
Oh. I'm worried my cousin's
going to cut it too short.

109
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:44,449
Me, too. I was up all night.

110
00:04:45,378 --> 00:04:46,468
Hello, Lily.

111
00:04:46,572 --> 00:04:47,280
Hey, Bill.

112
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:48,366
Hey, Barney.

113
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:50,836
Scooter, what are
you doing here?

114
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,664
It's not "Scooter" anymore.

115
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:54,118
It's Bill.

116
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:56,710
A lot of things have
changed about me, Lily,

117
00:04:56,816 --> 00:04:58,066
but one hasn't.

118
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,791
I still love you.

119
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,133
And I came here
to win you back.

120
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:05,829
You're really cute.
Oh, no. Really?

121
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:08,046
Lily, I-I know it's crazy,

122
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:09,975
but I love you,

123
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:12,343
and if you can
look me in the eye

124
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:14,213
and tell me that you
want to marry Marshall,

125
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:17,264
I will leave right now and
be out of your life forever.

126
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:18,600
I want...

127
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,013
I want...

128
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:24,202
Scooter!

129
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:25,549
I need a glass of wine.

130
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:27,684
And I need you to
get out of my face.

131
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,233
It's for the bride, so...

132
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:30,607
White or red?

133
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:31,851
White.

134
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,699
And, uh...
she'd also like a scotch and soda.

135
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:36,422
You got it.

136
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:38,980
She'd also like a bowl
of smoked almonds.

137
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:40,155
I don't have any,

138
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:42,556
but I guess I could run out
to the corner and get some.

139
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:45,376
Well, it's only the biggest
day of her life, so...

140
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:50,509
Let the games begin.

141
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,252
Here. Can't stay.
Got to try something.

142
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,225
Maybe my words won't
change your mind,

143
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,936
but maybe the words
of a poet will.

144
00:06:00,462 --> 00:06:04,192
I read from "November Rain."

145
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,311
By W. Axl Rose.

146
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,010
That is a good song.

147
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,241
Barney said you needed me to
bounce some guy named Scooter?

148
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:15,100
What's up with Bill?

149
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:16,252
That's Scooter.

150
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,082
I'm on it.

151
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,402
- Hey.
- Hey.

152
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:25,562
Can I have your phone number?

153
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,905
No.

154
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:28,973
It's for the bride.

155
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,704
Oh. Hold on.
Let me go get a pen.

156
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:36,132
The bride wants
you to walk slower.

157
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:40,783
Oh, wow.

158
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,224
Oh. Robin...

159
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:45,122
My makeup looks
perfect right now,

160
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:47,770
and I'm about to cry.
Do something.

161
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:50,725
I have hairy nipples.

162
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:51,576
Really?

163
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:53,353
No, but it worked, didn't it?

164
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:55,512
Hey. Funny story.

165
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,301
I tackled this guy I
thought was Scooter.

166
00:06:57,407 --> 00:06:58,935
Turns out it was
your photographer.

167
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:02,420
Don't worry. I got this sweet
camera phone, so we're covered.

168
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:05,080
There's a photographer?

169
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:06,156
Oh, my God.

170
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:08,687
- Okay, I just have to call...
- Robin, stop. Stop.

171
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:10,001
It's okay.

172
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:13,394
I am not gonna let
anything get to me today.

173
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:16,001
I just got a call from the florist.
The flowers won't be here

174
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:17,767
till halfway through
the ceremony.

175
00:07:20,254 --> 00:07:21,501
I'm okay.

176
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:25,409
I hate to bother you, but... I think
I found your veil in the parking lot.

177
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:27,495
I'm fine.

178
00:07:29,068 --> 00:07:31,123
Just FYI: my water broke.

179
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:32,606
But I can probably...

180
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,522
...make it through.

181
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:40,037
Totally cool.

182
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:43,583
Oh, no.

183
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:47,047
Lily, I think I forgot
your bridal panties.

184
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,083
I-I thought I had them.
I'm so sorry.

185
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:51,244
Oh, it's okay,
I'll just wear the ones I have on.

186
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:52,356
Are you sure?

187
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:54,485
I'm marrying Marshall today.

188
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,507
So it doesn't even matter that
I'm gonna walk down the aisle

189
00:07:57,616 --> 00:08:00,992
without a veil in a room
that has no flowers

190
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:04,659
to the music of half a harp
played by a woman who's crowning,

191
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:08,113
as my high school boyfriend
reads Guns N' Roses lyrics.

192
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:09,285
But that's okay,

193
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,863
because there's no photographer there
to take any pictures of it anyway.

194
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:15,781
Lily, are you okay?

195
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:18,194
What do you think?!
Of course I'm not okay!

196
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,648
Everything that could possibly
go wrong at my wedding has!

197
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,891
It's ruined!

198
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:24,890
What happened to "I don't
want a perfect wedding"?

199
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:28,604
Oh, grow up, Robin!
Of course I want a perfect wedding!

200
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,674
Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not
to care about the wedding, but...

201
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:38,013
I do. I... I'm supposed to
feel like a princess today.

202
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,198
And you will.

203
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:41,546
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

204
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,559
Why don't we go outside? I have
something that'll make you feel better.

205
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:47,895
What could you have that could
possibly make me feel better?

206
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,453
God, I hope Marshall's having
a better day than I'm having.

207
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,896
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

208
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:00,342
Oh, my God.

209
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,270
Oh, my God.

210
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,760
- Oh, my God!
- What?

211
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:14,410
Well, it's not too short.

212
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,956
My hair! Look at my hair!
She ruined my hair!

213
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:33,205
I look like one of
the Backstreet Boys!

214
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:34,221
You totally do.

215
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,785
And not even the good
Backstreet Boys,

216
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:39,239
the older, lame dance move,
comeback tour Backstreet Boys.

217
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:41,940
The good Backstreet Boys?

218
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,101
Guys! Guys!
What am I gonna do?!

219
00:09:44,204 --> 00:09:46,100
What-what the hell
happened to you?

220
00:09:46,204 --> 00:09:47,865
Lily's cousin is
in beauty school,

221
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:49,774
and Lily didn't want
her to do her hair,

222
00:09:49,877 --> 00:09:51,642
so she said she could do mine.

223
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:54,253
So, um,
just not-not too short, okay?

224
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:56,469
Oh, no,
we don't even have to cut it at all.

225
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:58,249
Could just give it some style.

226
00:09:58,355 --> 00:09:59,463
Oh, okay, yeah, that's great.

227
00:09:59,496 --> 00:10:02,124
'Cause, um, when it gets too short,
it starts to look weird.

228
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:04,373
And I don't want to look weird
when I'm up there, you know.

229
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:06,913
Ooh, I could give you
some cool guy tips.

230
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,894
I don't think I need
advice on how to be cool,

231
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,356
but yeah, great,
lay that on me.

232
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:16,302
I can't get married like this!
There's no way!

233
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:17,819
Ah, let me see what I can do.

234
00:10:17,922 --> 00:10:19,703
What? What can you do?

235
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:21,872
I have a superpower.

236
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:24,835
Lily is gonna kill me!

237
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:25,851
Look at me!

238
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:27,557
She's not gonna want
to marry me like this.

239
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:29,224
That's crazy.
Of course she will.

240
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,297
Would you marry me?

241
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:33,029
No. But not because of the hair.
It's because I have a rule:

242
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,970
never marry anyone you've
had a farting contest with.

243
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:40,008
Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily
and I shouldn't even get married?

244
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:44,465
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

245
00:10:45,503 --> 00:10:47,176
It's for the bride.

246
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:52,086
One, the bride would...

247
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,960
like all of this tension
out of my shoulders.

248
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:57,741
And she would like, let's say,

249
00:10:57,844 --> 00:11:00,542
you in the inappropriately
short dress to rub them.

250
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:01,928
Two...

251
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:05,262
What was two?

252
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:08,836
Okay, we have a
bit of a situation.

253
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:11,565
Let's not panic.

254
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:14,338
Let's just find a solution.

255
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:32,249
Dude, you shaved
your freakin' head.

256
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:34,295
Yeah, yeah, but it's good.

257
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,207
I ought to shave it all off.
What a great solution.

258
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:39,696
Just be bald 'cause
it's cool, right?

259
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:42,348
Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan,
Britney Spears...

260
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,516
Oh, God, what did I do?!

261
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:46,296
How could you let
me shave my head?!

262
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,060
- What?!
- You're the worst best man ever!

263
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,328
I hate you!

264
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:51,958
I'm not going out there!
I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.

265
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:53,998
I'm gonna go find that money
under the rock by the tree

266
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:56,217
and go live with the guys on
the beach in Zihautanejo.

267
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,319
Dude, those guys are criminals.

268
00:11:57,355 --> 00:11:59,891
Only Red Andy was
falsely accused.

269
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:02,589
Ted, you're my best man!
You got to do something!

270
00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:05,312
Okay, all right, come here.
Just breathe, breathe, all right?

271
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:07,500
Don't worry. Don't worry.

272
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,517
- I'll just... I'll take these.
- No!

273
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,375
- Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?
- Yes.

274
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:21,488
Yes, we're, we're having a little
bit of a problem back there.

275
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:23,558
Um, and I was wondering
if you could help us out.

276
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,519
Yeah.

277
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:29,803
Marshall accidentally
shaved part of his head.

278
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:31,537
- Oh, no!
- Yeah.

279
00:12:31,643 --> 00:12:33,527
Yeah, so here's what
I was thinking.

280
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:39,101
What if I found something
to cover up the bald area?

281
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:41,720
Yeah, that would probably work,

282
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:43,194
but with what?

283
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:46,338
That's a tough one.

284
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:50,610
Maybe a wig of some
sort or a, um...

285
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:51,837
toupee.

286
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,855
Something that matches
his hair color,

287
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:58,624
which is, which is kind of the same
color as the top of your hair.

288
00:12:59,018 --> 00:13:01,562
Mm, yeah.

289
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:04,263
Does anyone here wear a toupee?

290
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:06,089
Shouldn't be hard to find out.

291
00:13:06,193 --> 00:13:07,626
Most of them are pretty bad.

292
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:10,186
That is true. That is true.

293
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,795
We just need to find
someone who wears a toupee

294
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:14,755
that is the same color

295
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,983
as Marshall's and your hair.

296
00:13:20,152 --> 00:13:22,343
Boy, that's a
pretty tall order.

297
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,722
Really?

298
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:26,863
You can't think of any
place in the general area

299
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:29,203
where there might be a toupee of
the kind I'm describing to you?

300
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:31,451
No, not off the top of my...

301
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,941
No. Can't.

302
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:38,581
Let me come at this from a different
angle. I got $50 in my pocket

303
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:40,911
- which is probably a lot more...
- The bride needs this.

304
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,225
Actually, I think
it kinda works.

305
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,402
It totally does.

306
00:14:03,127 --> 00:14:04,284
Barney?

307
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,613
To be honest, I'm, uh,

308
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:11,262
I'm jealous I don't
get to wear it.

309
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:20,070
Okay, problem solved.

310
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:21,124
Crisis averted.

311
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:22,771
Let's get me married.

312
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:24,650
It looks terrible, doesn't it?

313
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:26,957
It kinda looks like fur,

314
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:29,750
which gives you the appearance
of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.

315
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:31,869
- Oh, you know...
- In a bad way.

316
00:14:32,624 --> 00:14:35,142
Hey. Cool hair, bro.

317
00:14:35,498 --> 00:14:36,537
What happened to your shirt?

318
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:38,968
I got sauce on it when
I tackled the caterer.

319
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:40,792
You gonna put another shirt on?

320
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:41,807
No, I'm good.

321
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,535
Hey, you guys seen Scooter?

322
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,242
What? What? Scooter's here?
That guy's at my wedding?

323
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,978
Not for long, bro.

324
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:50,735
Not for long.

325
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:56,076
Okay, you know what?
I need some air.

326
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:58,346
I think we should go
for a walk, okay?

327
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:03,016
It would cover up the problem.

328
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:04,328
It's festive

329
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:07,313
and it celebrates the heritage
of this great nation.

330
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,841
Okay, unless you actually
have one in your car,

331
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:12,863
stop suggesting authentic
Native American headdress.

332
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:14,178
Oh, no.

333
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:16,255
Oh, my God!

334
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:18,512
Marshall...

335
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,311
Lily, you're not
supposed to see me.

336
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:23,304
Holy crap, I don't think
anyone's supposed to see you.

337
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:25,812
What happened?
Did Amy do this to you?

338
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,664
Just the frosted tips.
I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby.

339
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,584
I've ruined the whole wedding,
haven't I?

340
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,941
Oh, no,
you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie.

341
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:34,438
It was already ruined.

342
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:36,255
There's no flowers,
no photographer.

343
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,124
Oh, and Scooter's here,
by the way.

344
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,108
Yeah, I know. I heard.

345
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:42,198
My veil got thrashed,
the harp player is in labor,

346
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:44,387
and I'm not wearing
my wedding underwear.

347
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:47,010
What? No "Property of
Marshall" across the back?

348
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:49,129
How are people going to
know whose butt that is?

349
00:15:49,235 --> 00:15:50,887
What happened?

350
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:55,975
Remember the wedding we wanted,
the intimate outdoor ceremony?

351
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,832
I wish we could
have that wedding.

352
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:01,900
So do it.

353
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:02,792
What?

354
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,281
Get married now.

355
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,707
Right here.

356
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:08,136
Look, it's outside like
you always wanted.

357
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,255
Intimate, close friends.

358
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:12,946
There's no guitar,
but it's pretty close.

359
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:14,833
Barney can officiate.

360
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,508
Yes. Yes, I can.

361
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:21,902
Uh, excuse me, guys.
You all dropped something:

362
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:23,257
your jaws--

363
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,796
because Barney Stinson is about
to aid and abet a marriage.

364
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:31,368
Could we even do that? I mean,
what about all those people in there?

365
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:33,517
Do that one, too.
And then when everything goes wrong,

366
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:36,599
you won't care because you already
had the real wedding out here.

367
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:40,113
What do you think, baby?

368
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:42,092
I love it.

369
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:43,399
Me, too.

370
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,512
Let's do it.
Let's get married before we get married.

371
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:47,895
Great.

372
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,914
Wait, hold on.

373
00:16:51,497 --> 00:16:53,005
Excuse me, sir.

374
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:55,246
Could we borrow your hat?

375
00:16:56,524 --> 00:16:57,466
Okay.

376
00:16:57,572 --> 00:16:58,882
Thank you.

377
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:08,268
Hat.

378
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:10,930
We thought of authentic
Native American headdress

379
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:13,069
before we thought of hat.

380
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,671
Thank you all for coming.

381
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:20,458
For those of you
who don't know me...

382
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:23,842
I'm not the biggest
believer in marriage.

383
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:30,480
But... you two are so great together,
you know?

384
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,532
It's like you were, uh,
made for each other.

385
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:40,862
- He's gonna cry.
- No, I'm not.

386
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,187
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not,
I'm not, I'm not.

387
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:55,318
Lily and Marshall...

388
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:59,154
when everyone sees you, they...

389
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,324
see true love.

390
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:05,820
It's the best love...

391
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:14,194
Can we just, um,
move on to the rings or something?

392
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:18,833
Oh, no.

393
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:21,332
I don't have my vows.

394
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,871
I don't have mine either.

395
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:26,396
You don't need your vows.
Just say why you love each other.

396
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:30,439
Okay, I'll go first.

397
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,157
Lily,

398
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:37,691
there are a million
reasons why I love you.

399
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,039
You make me laugh

400
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:42,803
and you take care of
me when I'm sick.

401
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:47,931
You're sweet, caring and you even
created an egg dish and named it after me.

402
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:50,794
She puts a little Italian dressing in
scrambled eggs before she cooks them.

403
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:53,484
It's called "Eggs Marshall,"
and it's awesome.

404
00:18:55,228 --> 00:18:58,003
But the main reason
that I love you is

405
00:18:58,108 --> 00:19:00,043
that you're my
best friend, Lily.

406
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:03,062
You're, uh...
you're the best friend I ever had.

407
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,172
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- No problem.

408
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,558
It's totally okay.

409
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,180
My turn.

410
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:11,035
Oh, thank you.

411
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:16,891
Marshall, I love you
because you're funny

412
00:19:16,993 --> 00:19:19,591
and you make me feel loved

413
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:22,362
and you make me feel safe

414
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:26,147
and for our anniversary you
gave me a sweatshirt that says,

415
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:29,540
"Lily and Marshall.
Rockin' It Since '96."

416
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,357
I kinda wish I was
wearing it right now

417
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:35,517
'cause it smells like you.

418
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:39,524
But the main reason I love you,
Marshall Ericksen,

419
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:42,567
is you make me happy.

420
00:19:43,074 --> 00:19:45,348
You make me happy all the time.

421
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,187
Hey, I found your panties!

422
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:54,303
I'm good.

423
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,421
Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife
to have and to hold from this day forward?

424
00:19:58,459 --> 00:19:59,277
- Slow down.
- I can't.

425
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,322
From this day forward so as
long as you both shall live?

426
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,329
I do.

427
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,944
Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to
be your husband to have and to hold... live?

428
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:06,707
I do.

429
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,041
Okay, then,

430
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:12,118
by the power invested in me by
the very bitter old Pakistani man

431
00:20:12,222 --> 00:20:14,727
who works down at the
courthouse on Lafayette Street,

432
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:18,152
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

433
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,122
You may kiss the bride.

434
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:29,528
- Do you smoke?
- No.

435
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:33,154
Wow. First lie of marriage.
That was fast.

436
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:38,182
After that, we all went back
inside for the second wedding.

437
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,244
And yes,
a lot of things did go wrong,

438
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:41,407
but it didn't matter

439
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:43,655
because when I look
back on that day,

440
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:45,706
what I remember is
the first wedding;

441
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:47,833
the intimate outdoor ceremony

442
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,601
with just close friends

443
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:51,620
and an acoustic guitar.

444
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:04,730
How do you feel?

445
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:07,931
Tired. I got
married twice today.

446
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:14,771
So where do you want to do it for
the first time as a married couple,

447
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,672
nice hotel room or a
reception hall bathroom?

448
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,118
What do you think?

449
00:21:19,223 --> 00:21:21,308
Bathroom, of course.

450
00:21:22,277 --> 00:21:23,929
Please don't.

451
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:27,008
- Sorry, Ted.
- Sorry, Ted.
