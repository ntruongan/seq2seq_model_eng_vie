1
00:00:00,872 --> 00:00:04,056
Kids, I told you stories
about all the big holidays--

2
00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:05,405
Christmas...

3
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:07,123
Halloween...

4
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,304
Thanksgiving...

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,035
but one holiday was
always my favorite--

6
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:14,799
Super Bowl Sunday.

7
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,620
And there was one
Super Bowl back in 2007

8
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,280
that I will never forget.

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,843
Marshall, you're
on beer detail.

10
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,736
Lily, you're making
the bean dip.

11
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:24,855
Uh, Robin,
you're on chips and pretzels,

12
00:00:24,862 --> 00:00:26,526
and Barney,
I'm giving you nothing to do

13
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:29,373
so you can just focus on
controlling your gambling problem.

14
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:30,846
"Problem."

15
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:33,116
Oh, poor Superman,
he should really do something

16
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:35,189
about his flying problem.

17
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,017
It's not a problem if
you're awesome at it.

18
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:42,096
And I will be going to Quinn's to
pick up the world's greatest food,

19
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:44,369
the Super Bowl
Hot Wings Platter.

20
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:47,248
If I were a chicken,
I'd go cannibal for those bad boys.

21
00:00:47,262 --> 00:00:49,097
Just eat my own damn wing off.
I don't care.

22
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:51,046
I'm crazy like that.

23
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:53,739
Here's the info
for tomorrow night.

24
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:54,916
What's tomorrow night?

25
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:57,436
Oh, God, you didn't hear?

26
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:59,328
Mark died.

27
00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:02,268
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.

28
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:04,027
The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00,
and I know

29
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,478
it would have meant a
lot to Mark if you came.

30
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:09,388
You guys were his
favorite customers.

31
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:12,919
- Stay strong.
- We're so sorry.

32
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,168
Who was Mark?

33
00:01:17,183 --> 00:01:19,516
- No idea.
- Not a clue.

34
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:23,488
Well, I guess we
should go, right?

35
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,776
Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00,
that's the Super Bowl.

36
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:31,659
Okay, I feel terrible,
but the truth is we didn't know Mike.

37
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:32,529
- Mark.
- Mark,

38
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:34,578
and as long as we send flowers,

39
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:36,749
I can't think of any
reason we'd have to go.

40
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:38,008
Get out of here!

41
00:01:38,024 --> 00:01:40,817
I never want to see your
face in this bar again!

42
00:01:42,774 --> 00:01:46,506
This soulless bastard just told me
he can't come to Mark's funeral

43
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,728
because he wants to
watch the Super Bowl.

44
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,627
Could you believe that?

45
00:01:52,203 --> 00:01:54,037
You guys are coming, right?

46
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:55,682
Yes... Wouldn't
miss for the world.

47
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:58,679
Sync by vNaru

48
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:10,969
Okay, here's the plan :

49
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:13,136
record the game,
go to the funeral,

50
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:14,896
- pay our respects to Matt...
- Mark.

51
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:18,268
Mark, and start watching
only an hour late.

52
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:21,488
Okay, that's great,
but just to make sure it records,

53
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:23,267
maybe we should bow our
heads and say a quiet prayer

54
00:02:23,304 --> 00:02:24,918
to the TiVo gods.

55
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:29,249
Almighty TiVo,

56
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:32,348
we thank you for all the
gifts you have given us:

57
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:34,666
the power to freeze live
TV to go take a leak

58
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:36,546
is nothing short of Godlike.

59
00:02:37,153 --> 00:02:39,826
Let's not forget fast-forwarding
through commercials.

60
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:42,786
It seems greedy to ask
anything more from you,

61
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:44,698
O magic box,

62
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:48,598
but if you malfunction
and miss the Super Bowl,

63
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:51,126
we will destroy you in the
alley with baseball bats.

64
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:52,399
- Amen.
- Amen.

65
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:54,728
We are not fast-forwarding
through the commercials.

66
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:55,917
Yeah, they're the best part.

67
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:57,806
Oh, come on.
Remember last year?

68
00:02:57,822 --> 00:03:01,269
Who wants to watch a monkey in
a coconut bra order a pizza?

69
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:03,716
Oh, my God.
This monkey was so cute.

70
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:07,789
Seriously, that's the last
time I'm gonna call you today.

71
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:08,958
Okay.

72
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:10,628
Good-bye.

73
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:12,876
You didn't hang up either!

74
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,737
I know! You hang up!

75
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:16,337
You hang up!

76
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:19,906
My bookie. Great guy.

77
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:23,458
So let me get this straight. A funeral
is the one time you don't suit up?

78
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,407
Have I taught you nothing, Ted?

79
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,688
Virtually.

80
00:03:26,702 --> 00:03:28,769
Suits are full of joy.

81
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:32,149
They're the sartorial
equivalent of a baby's smile.

82
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:33,247
"Sartorial"?

83
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:35,328
"Of or pertaining to
tailors or their trade."

84
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,206
Suits are for the living.

85
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:38,876
That's why when it's
my time to R.I.P.

86
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:41,089
I'm going out of this world
the same way I came into it--

87
00:03:41,124 --> 00:03:43,506
buck naked. Yeah.

88
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:44,939
It's gonna be awesome.

89
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:48,077
Open bar for the guys,
open casket for the ladies.

90
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:49,787
What up?!

91
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:23,437
- Such a waste.
- I know.

92
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:24,998
He was so young.

93
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:28,417
A hand-stitched, cashmere,
double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana.

94
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:30,486
It must be so frightened.

95
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:32,779
This is going faster
than I thought.

96
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,767
We'll make an appearance
at the bar for the wake,

97
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:36,746
we'll be watching
the game by 8:00.

98
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:39,359
And even though we
didn't see any whales,

99
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:42,798
Mark and I both said it was
the best day of our lives.

100
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:45,967
Okay, I'm getting
us another round.

101
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:47,798
And when I come back,

102
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:50,786
everyone else is telling
their favorite Mark story.

103
00:04:53,652 --> 00:04:55,859
Dibs on the one Carl just told.

104
00:04:56,442 --> 00:05:00,048
Okay, I have to be at work
exactly one Super Bowl from now.

105
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:02,037
Oh, let's face it,
we're not going to get to watch it.

106
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:03,719
We should just find
out the score.

107
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,179
Oh, thank God! I'll find out.

108
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:07,859
No, no, no, we can't!
We have to watch the game together.

109
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,116
It's tradition.

110
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:12,069
Think of all the great times
we've had watching this game.

111
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,857
Second down, everyone drink.

112
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:17,437
Ted, it's not a drinking game

113
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,886
if you drink anytime
anything happens.

114
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:22,138
Are these chicken
wings or angel wings?

115
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:24,077
God, I love these things.

116
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:26,228
I love you guys.

117
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,847
This is so great, all of us
watching the Super Bowl together.

118
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,907
This is special.

119
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:35,706
We need to do this every year--
promise me!

120
00:05:35,722 --> 00:05:37,196
Calm down, buddy.

121
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,826
Oh, commercials!

122
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:40,547
Everyone drink!

123
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:47,347
God, this is such a great tradition,
all of us watching the game together.

124
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,096
How did this start?

125
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:51,977
Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks
that Casey misses this field goal.

126
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:54,458
I don't bet.
Betting's for suckers.

127
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:57,149
Make it like a dollar or something,
you know. Who cares? No big deal.

128
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:58,859
Fine.

129
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,529
See, there you go, he made it.
You win.

130
00:06:02,543 --> 00:06:05,518
Wait. This is mine,
just like that?

131
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:07,826
God, that feels good.

132
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:10,567
No, that feels really... good.

133
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:11,989
What else can we bet on?

134
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,076
Nothing, it's the
halftime show.

135
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:16,808
Oh, so lame.

136
00:06:16,822 --> 00:06:18,529
Nobody even pays attention.

137
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,367
I mean, Janet Jackson,
who cares?

138
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:27,646
God, how cool is Robin?

139
00:06:27,664 --> 00:06:30,396
I can't believe you invited this girl
we've only known for a few months

140
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,007
to our sacred day.

141
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:33,708
Now she's gonna be
in all the pictures.

142
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:35,316
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
I'll give you the Seahawks

143
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:37,137
plus six points for 500 bucks.

144
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:39,206
Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.

145
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:41,125
$50?! What fun is $50?!

146
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:44,336
Why don't we just bet air?!
God, Marshall!

147
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:45,663
Okay, $50.

148
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:46,939
Hey, I'll take that action.

149
00:06:46,951 --> 00:06:49,296
Seahawks, but make it four
points and make it a grand.

150
00:06:49,312 --> 00:06:52,158
Hey, these wings,
are they chicken wings or angel wings?

151
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:53,436
Oh, commercials!

152
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:56,547
Monkey with a coconut
bra. Hilarious.

153
00:06:57,804 --> 00:07:00,349
Look, we always watch
the Super Bowl together.

154
00:07:00,362 --> 00:07:03,079
So we make a pact to
watch it tomorrow at 6:00

155
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:05,746
and go the next 18 hours
without finding out who won.

156
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:07,448
That's impossible.

157
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:09,577
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It's not gonna be easy.

158
00:07:09,593 --> 00:07:12,237
That means no TV, no Internet,

159
00:07:12,254 --> 00:07:13,998
no newspapers, nothing.

160
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:15,688
Media blackout.

161
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,419
But our tradition lives on.

162
00:07:17,432 --> 00:07:19,089
Who's in?

163
00:07:19,803 --> 00:07:21,209
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

164
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:23,059
- I'm in.
- What the hell, I'm in.

165
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:26,149
- High five!
- Dude, we're at a wake.

166
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:29,078
Sorry. Solemn low five.

167
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,756
As the day began, none of us had
any idea how hard it would be

168
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:38,218
to go nine hours without hearing
the outcome of the Super Bowl.

169
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:40,658
I decided to work from home
to avoid contamination

170
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:42,777
by the outside world.

171
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:50,199
Hey, take this key
and swallow it.

172
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:51,288
What? No.

173
00:07:51,301 --> 00:07:54,086
Come on, Ted, you eat salads.
It'll be out by game time.

174
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:55,868
Lots more, no.

175
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:57,519
I'm not messing
around, Theodore.

176
00:07:57,532 --> 00:08:00,059
I've got a lot of money
riding on this game.

177
00:08:00,073 --> 00:08:02,218
If I don't handcuff
myself to this radiator,

178
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,509
I'll check the score.
Please take the key.

179
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:05,618
Fine.

180
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:07,447
But only because you didn't
think through a bathroom plan

181
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:09,579
and I think that's funny.

182
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:20,949
The media blackout was
particularly hard on Robin

183
00:08:20,962 --> 00:08:23,518
because, well,
she was the media.

184
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:25,807
But unfortunately,
the City won't be fixing

185
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:28,296
the unusually large
pothole any time soon,

186
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:31,069
so buckle up if
you're on the BQE.

187
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:33,018
It's gonna be a bumpy one.

188
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:35,576
Like morning commutes
needed to get any harder.

189
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:37,227
You're right, Kevin.

190
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:40,756
Well, Robin, what do you say?
I think it's time to check in with Sid

191
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:42,956
- for a sports update.
- No!

192
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:45,546
- What?
- No.

193
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,399
But it's, uh, time for Sports.

194
00:08:48,414 --> 00:08:52,278
No, it's not.
It's time for Weather.

195
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:54,566
We, we just did Weather.

196
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:56,929
Well, weather's pretty fickle,

197
00:08:56,942 --> 00:08:58,167
it may have changed.

198
00:08:58,181 --> 00:09:00,548
What's it doing out there, Lou?

199
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:06,298
Pretty much the same thing
it was two minutes ago.

200
00:09:06,353 --> 00:09:08,457
Back to you, Robin.

201
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:13,027
Okay, now it's time for Sports.

202
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:15,918
No! Let's go to Traffic Todd

203
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,967
in the Metro News
1 Gridlock Chopper.

204
00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:19,987
Robin, it's time for Sports!

205
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:24,596
Over to you, Sid.

206
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:28,409
Thank you, Kevin and Robin.

207
00:09:28,423 --> 00:09:31,059
Let's talk about
the Super Bowl.

208
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:33,506
Weeks earlier,
Marshall had promised Lily

209
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:36,487
he'd come into her kindergarten
class for show-and-tell day.

210
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:38,968
And he's a little
bit double-jointed...

211
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:42,626
And his favorite animal
is the Loch Ness monster.

212
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:44,368
Lily, how many times...?

213
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,138
Nessie is a gentle creature.

214
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:49,076
We're trying to stay away
from terms like "Monster."

215
00:09:49,563 --> 00:09:53,109
Well, I think we can all agree,
he is much more interesting

216
00:09:53,123 --> 00:09:55,398
than Sally's one-eyed goldfish.

217
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:57,997
Three weeks in a row?
Come on, Sally.

218
00:09:58,713 --> 00:10:01,276
Okay, well,
that's all the time we have.

219
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:03,246
Arts and crafts, everybody.

220
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:08,689
Hey. I'm Doug.

221
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:10,858
Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.

222
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:15,329
Are you going to be staying
here for the rest of day?

223
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:17,239
Yeah, I'm actually
trying to hide out

224
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:19,568
'cause I don't want to know
who won the Super Bowl.

225
00:10:19,582 --> 00:10:21,519
I know who won.

226
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:24,208
Oh, um, that's great,
but I really don't want to know,

227
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,487
so if you could just
keep that to yourself.

228
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:30,418
How badly do you
not want to know?

229
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:32,498
Excuse me?

230
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:34,486
Ten bucks.

231
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:36,079
Are you serious?

232
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,336
Just went up to eight.

233
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:40,579
Unlock me, Ted.

234
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:42,896
I've never gone this long
without calling my bookie.

235
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:44,388
He worries.

236
00:10:45,294 --> 00:10:47,009
Not until game time.

237
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:49,186
Where are you going?

238
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:50,546
Pick up the hot wings.

239
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:53,176
What? How the hell are
you planning on getting

240
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:55,478
in and out of a sports bar
without seeing the score?

241
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:56,697
There's TVs everywhere.

242
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:58,236
Ah, don't worry.

243
00:10:58,251 --> 00:10:59,747
I got it all planned out.

244
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:01,247
First of all:

245
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:03,499
I placed duct tape on
a pair of sunglasses

246
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:05,918
so I can only see out
of two tiny holes.

247
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:09,719
Next, I constructed blinders
out of an old cereal box.

248
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:12,559
Top it all off:
high-tech noise-reducing headphones

249
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,579
I bought when Marshall and
Lily first got back together

250
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:16,118
and were doing it a lot.

251
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:19,927
I call it the Sensory
Deprivator 5000.

252
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:45,357
Hello! Uh,
my name is Ted Mosby.

253
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,176
I'm here to pick
up my hot wings.

254
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:49,539
In my hand, you'll find the
exact total for the wings

255
00:11:49,553 --> 00:11:51,486
plus a generous tip.

256
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:53,099
Please take the cash.

257
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,199
Put the wings in my hand
and I'll be on my way.

258
00:11:58,061 --> 00:11:59,727
Thank you!

259
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:08,088
And that closes the book on
one heck of a Super Bowl.

260
00:12:08,104 --> 00:12:10,116
Back to you, Kevin and Robin.

261
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:16,197
We'll be right back.

262
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:19,028
And we're clear.

263
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:20,417
I'm sorry.

264
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:22,049
Um, Robin, is it just me,

265
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:23,528
or were you doing
something different there?

266
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:25,479
I haven't watched the game yet.

267
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,007
I'm begging you,
for the rest of the newscast

268
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:29,797
there can't be any references
to who won the Super Bowl.

269
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:31,509
I mean,
change the teleprompter.

270
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:33,609
No team names,
nothing specific.

271
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:36,126
That is crazy. I can't do that.

272
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:40,118
My friend Mark passed
away this week.

273
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:42,638
Okay, sweety okay.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

274
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:44,577
Back in five... four...

275
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:46,547
- three...
- It's just so hard.

276
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:17,029
Ha! Who's the idiot now?!

277
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:20,299
You said the Sensory
Deprivator 5000 was stupid.

278
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:21,896
But it totally worked!

279
00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:24,638
I couldn't see or hear
anything happening around me.

280
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:26,988
Right?! Right?!

281
00:13:28,304 --> 00:13:29,918
No...!

282
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:32,958
And if that weren't bad enough,

283
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:35,479
I was about to have a
horrible realization.

284
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:37,376
Where's the dipping sauce?

285
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:43,178
The team that won, want to know
what their name rhymes with?

286
00:13:43,193 --> 00:13:45,147
Come on, dude.
You promised you'd stop

287
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:47,116
if I ate all those crayons.

288
00:13:47,134 --> 00:13:49,139
Why are you doing this?

289
00:13:49,972 --> 00:13:52,356
I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.

290
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:56,558
Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin,
she's mine.

291
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:07,289
Okay, now who did this?

292
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:13,006
I did.

293
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:15,836
Does that mean Marshall
gets a time-out?

294
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:18,889
Well, Marshall's
a grownup, so...

295
00:14:18,903 --> 00:14:21,978
When one of us breaks something,
we get a time-out.

296
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,638
Sorry.

297
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:33,517
And after the Super Bowl,

298
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:36,389
the mayor of the losing
team's city had to pay up,

299
00:14:36,403 --> 00:14:38,319
sending the mayor of
the winning team's city

300
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:42,789
15 pounds of a delicacy his
or her city is famous for.

301
00:14:42,803 --> 00:14:46,359
Better fire up whatever type of grill,
steamer or fryer

302
00:14:46,374 --> 00:14:50,918
one might use to cook that delicacy,
Winning Team's Mayor.

303
00:14:51,581 --> 00:14:52,936
Hey.

304
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:56,127
- Hey.
- I'm not talking to you.

305
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:57,399
Yes, you are.

306
00:14:57,412 --> 00:14:59,299
You'll do whatever I say.

307
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:02,109
- Hold your breath.
- I'm not holding my breath.

308
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:03,967
The winning team was the...

309
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:07,039
Now here's how this
is going to work:

310
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:10,219
you're going to take me to
three R-rated movies a week...

311
00:15:10,232 --> 00:15:12,226
And then Uncle
Marshall got an idea.

312
00:15:12,241 --> 00:15:14,406
It was not one he was
proud of in retrospect,

313
00:15:14,422 --> 00:15:16,549
but desperate times...

314
00:15:20,872 --> 00:15:22,816
Oh, no.

315
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:25,107
Somebody wet their pants.

316
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:26,606
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, really?

317
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:27,886
Who's everyone gonna believe?

318
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:30,009
I'm a grownup third-year
law student at Columbia

319
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:33,526
and you're just a little pants wetter.
So now I ask you a question:

320
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:36,498
You want to be able to quietly sneak
off to the restroom and dry off

321
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:39,259
or am I gonna have something
for show and tell today?

322
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,916
- Hey, everyone...
- Okay, okay.

323
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:43,668
You win.

324
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:45,466
I want my money back.

325
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:51,529
And your pudding snack pack.

326
00:15:56,113 --> 00:15:58,087
Sir, who won the Super Bowl?

327
00:15:58,101 --> 00:15:59,696
Sorry. I missed the game.

328
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:01,349
You missed...?!
How could he miss...?

329
00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:03,137
Excuse me!
Who won the Super Bowl?!

330
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:05,176
I... don't really
follow sports.

331
00:16:05,192 --> 00:16:06,727
Oh, my...!

332
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:09,969
Emmitt Smith!

333
00:16:10,064 --> 00:16:11,648
Oh, thank God.

334
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:13,246
Yeah, I get that a lot.

335
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,778
You got to tell me,
who won the Super Bowl?

336
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,007
The game was last night?

337
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,978
You know, once you win two
or three of those things,

338
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,627
it's kind of like, eh.

339
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:26,566
But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a
football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday.

340
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:29,848
What could possibly be more
important than football?!

341
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:34,066
Dance, my friend. Dance.

342
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:39,399
No...!

343
00:16:57,632 --> 00:16:59,997
Hello! It's me again.

344
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:02,946
Oh! I didn't recognize you.

345
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:06,228
Yeah, you forgot to give
me the dipping sauce!

346
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:12,189
Ah. Yes.

347
00:17:12,204 --> 00:17:13,557
This is the one.

348
00:17:13,572 --> 00:17:17,359
It was 4:00, and so far,
all of us had done the impossible.

349
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:20,238
But then,
almost simultaneously,

350
00:17:20,251 --> 00:17:21,978
things started to go wrong.

351
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:24,137
And let's end the
day on a happy note.

352
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:26,099
There is a new arrival
at the Bronx Zoo.

353
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,798
Trish Sanchez has the story.

354
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:42,387
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, dude, look out.

355
00:17:43,781 --> 00:17:46,957
And in honor of
yesterday's big win...

356
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:57,438
- Hey, buddy, look out.
- Dude, watch out!

357
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:01,906
...the zoo decided to
name the baby panda

358
00:18:01,923 --> 00:18:04,036
after Super Bowl champions...

359
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:05,467
No...!

360
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:08,649
No...!

361
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:11,066
No...!

362
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:23,936
Yes...!

363
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:31,167
Awesome. Just in
time for kick-off.

364
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:32,959
None of you guys found
out the score, right?

365
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:34,767
- Mission accomplished.
- Didn't find out.

366
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:37,189
Great. Let's do it.
I already fast-forwarded

367
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,726
through the four hours of pre-game
coverage. So we are ready.

368
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:43,576
Barney, I can't
even look at you.

369
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:45,297
I don't want any
sign of who won.

370
00:18:45,314 --> 00:18:48,008
Don't worry,
I'm not going to give anything away.

371
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:49,797
Feel free to start without me.

372
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:54,769
Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

373
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:56,796
So much money!
You screwed it up, Barney!

374
00:18:56,814 --> 00:19:00,107
You screwed everything up!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

375
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:02,687
Okay, let's watch the game.

376
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:05,547
Barney, what the hell was that?
We know who you bet on.

377
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,899
Now you've ruined the
game for everyone.

378
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:10,529
Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.

379
00:19:10,544 --> 00:19:11,677
Way to blow it.

380
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:14,409
Yeah, I didn't know
and now I do know.

381
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:17,457
There's no point in
even watching the game.

382
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:26,639
Well, at least the
commercials aren't ruined.

383
00:19:26,924 --> 00:19:28,368
Wings are still good.

384
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:30,157
Beer still works.

385
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:34,359
Ah, what the hell.

386
00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:36,457
Let's watch Barney
lose some money.

387
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,059
Hey, so check this out:

388
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:41,686
I got extorted by a
five-year-old today.

389
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:43,969
I almost got fired today.

390
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,426
I met Emmitt Smith today.

391
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:46,586
Ooh, you go first.

392
00:19:46,604 --> 00:19:48,967
I tried out the Sensory
Deprivator 5000.

393
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:50,749
Yeah, go ahead, Barney.

394
00:19:50,943 --> 00:19:53,287
Well, I was frantically
running down the street

395
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:55,147
trying to find out the
score to the game...

396
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:56,656
And here's the funny part,

397
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:59,087
as unforgettable as
that Super Bowl was,

398
00:19:59,104 --> 00:20:03,068
here it is 23 years later and
I don't remember who won...

399
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,498
Hell, I don't even
remember who played.

400
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:08,079
What I do remember is
that we drank beer,

401
00:20:08,104 --> 00:20:11,106
we ate wings and we watched
the Super Bowl together.

402
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:16,249
Because sometimes, even if you know
how something's going to end,

403
00:20:16,272 --> 00:20:18,837
that doesn't mean you
can't enjoy the ride.

404
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,556
We even raised a toast
to good old Mike.

405
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:23,569
I mean Mark. Matt.

406
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:25,677
Crap! Why do I keep doing that?

407
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:32,748
I didn't only lose the game,
I lost every single prop bet.

408
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:36,257
Total penalty yardage,
number of replay-challenges,

409
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:37,328
coin toss...

410
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:39,767
What are the odds of
losing the coin toss?

411
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,638
50-50, give or take.

412
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:46,009
Interceptions, field-goals,
total sacks,

413
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:49,206
whether or not there'd
be a safety, first...
