1
00:00:01,559 --> 00:00:03,488
This is awesome.

2
00:00:03,593 --> 00:00:06,018
I can't believe this
moment's finally here.

3
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:09,572
One more mile and my
little boy turns 200,000.

4
00:00:09,602 --> 00:00:12,971
Your baby Fiero's grown into
a really old man Fiero.

5
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:14,512
And just like an old man,

6
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:16,420
he leaks fluid, smells stale,

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,067
makes weird noises
out the back.

8
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:19,239
Yeah, he does.

9
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,452
Hey, light up those cigars
in the glove compartment.

10
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:24,262
They're real Cubans.
I got 'em in Chinatown last year

11
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:25,494
just for this moment.

12
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,462
Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying
you were definitely ripped off,

13
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:31,868
but these are chopsticks
wrapped in napkins.

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,437
- What are you talking about?
- Whoa, pothole.

15
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,933
What? No. Oh. No.

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,477
No, no, no.

17
00:00:37,512 --> 00:00:40,095
No, there's only .8 miles to go.
Come on, buddy.

18
00:00:40,128 --> 00:00:41,285
Buddy!

19
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:48,954
Is it cool if I
still light these?

20
00:00:51,022 --> 00:00:53,522
Sync by vNaru

21
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:09,479
Kids, sometimes life forces us to
be someone we didn't want to be.

22
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:13,377
When that happens, we often try to hold
on to a little piece of who we were.

23
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:15,134
Maybe a tattoo.

24
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,439
Or a piece of jewelry.

25
00:01:17,565 --> 00:01:20,888
A tiny souvenir that reminds us,
"This is who I really am."

26
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:23,755
Marshall's souvenir
was not so tiny,

27
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:26,711
but the more he found himself being
pushed toward the corporate world

28
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:29,249
and away from his dream of
saving the environment,

29
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:31,795
the tighter he held
on to that Fiero.

30
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:32,966
Hey.

31
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:36,146
One good thing: we're off the
hook for the folding party today.

32
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:39,635
Hey. It's very important
to both Lily and me

33
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:43,314
that there be a handmade origami
crane in each of our wedding's...

34
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,289
I couldn't even get through it.
Thank God.

35
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,185
Hey, your car's
going to be fine.

36
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:50,221
This is the best
auto shop around.

37
00:01:50,256 --> 00:01:51,916
Look at this certificate.

38
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:53,771
One of the mechanics here

39
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:56,425
finished a 64-ounce steak.

40
00:01:57,402 --> 00:01:58,481
Surprise.

41
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:00,236
We felt bad that you
guys were missing

42
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:03,042
the super-fun origami
folding party, so...

43
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,556
we suggested moving it here.

44
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,101
We insisted.

45
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:07,644
Terrific.

46
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:09,470
How's the Fiero?

47
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:11,395
She's still in triage.

48
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:13,819
She? I thought it
was your little boy.

49
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:17,159
Oh, it goes back and forth.
It's sort of a tranny car.

50
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:20,649
How long have you had her...
slash him?

51
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:23,684
My brothers handed it
down to me when I was 16.

52
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:25,180
Oh, how nice of them.

53
00:02:25,214 --> 00:02:26,672
Not really.

54
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:28,638
Congratulations.

55
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:30,444
The Fiero is yours.

56
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:35,186
If you pass the final test.

57
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,567
Come on!

58
00:02:36,604 --> 00:02:40,126
I already shaved my legs and
swallowed five dollars in quarters.

59
00:02:40,164 --> 00:02:42,153
Only $4.50 has come out.

60
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,361
Just go to the
Weinerburger drive-thru

61
00:02:45,394 --> 00:02:47,256
and get us 12 cups of coffee.

62
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:49,629
- That's it?
- Oh, yeah.

63
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:51,636
But we get to decide
what you wear.

64
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:56,046
Agreed. Totally agreed.

65
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:01,609
You're naked.

66
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:03,366
I'm aware of that.

67
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,810
You have 50 cents?

68
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:11,517
No...

69
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:14,833
Look, can I just have
my coffee, please?

70
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,331
Sorry, we're all out
of trays and lids.

71
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,747
Two tall guys just came through here
a few minutes ago and bought 'em all.

72
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,771
And that is the origin
of Marshall's insane

73
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,535
"no food or drinks in the Fiero,
not even groceries" rule.

74
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,220
It is not insane.

75
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:49,219
Barney. That's like the third one
in a row that you've screwed up.

76
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:51,137
Well, I'm trying, but it's...

77
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:54,616
Look. You fold twice to the middle,
fold back and forth, pull the ends out,

78
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,623
flip over, open the flaps, fold the
edges, crease the front, fold in half,

79
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:01,664
fold the wings down, push in the bottom
corners, and fold the wings back out.

80
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:04,930
Or would you like one of my
kindergartners to show you?

81
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:07,909
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, I think I've got it.

82
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:10,566
No.

83
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,853
Forget it; the paper's too expensive.
You're out.

84
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,578
Aw, nerts.

85
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:21,631
The food rule is insane.
We could have died because of it.

86
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:24,690
- Remember the 100K fiasco?
- Ah, the Fiero-asco.

87
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:28,210
Dude, I told you that doesn't work.
It's the 100K fiasco.

88
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:30,756
- What's the 100K fiasco?
- The Fiero-asco?

89
00:04:31,222 --> 00:04:33,583
It was just before winter break
our freshman year of college.

90
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:36,109
Marshall and I were roommates,
but we weren't really good friends yet.

91
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:38,644
I thought Ted was a
little bit pretentious.

92
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,174
And Marshall was a total slob.

93
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:43,115
Hey.

94
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:46,747
I'm driving my Fiero
back over break.

95
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:48,872
I know we see enough of
each other as it is,

96
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:51,567
but if you want a ride,
I could use the gas money.

97
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:54,598
You live in Ohio, right?
I could swing through and pick you up.

98
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,104
All right, first of all,
my parents live in Ohio.

99
00:04:58,138 --> 00:05:00,242
I live in the moment.

100
00:05:00,806 --> 00:05:03,731
Plus, Karen and I haven't seen
each other since Thanksgiving.

101
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:07,821
We're both really invested in making
this long-distance thing work, so...

102
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:10,065
All right, well,
call me if you change your mind.

103
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,162
My odometer's
going to hit 100K.

104
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:16,242
She'd be so bummed
if I left early.

105
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,879
It was totally mutual.

106
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:22,087
I mean, Karen brought it up first,
but I...

107
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,663
it was...
it was totally mutual.

108
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:26,557
I hear you.

109
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:29,486
So what's up with you and Lily?
Anything serious?

110
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,838
Yeah.

111
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,543
Dude, we're college freshmen.

112
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,258
I'm not going to get tied down by
the first chick I hook up with.

113
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:39,290
Lily's cool, but this bird
you'll never chain, you know?

114
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:43,068
The next few hours of our
drive were classic road trip.

115
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,980
So... this song.

116
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:57,955
Oh, it's the best
song in the world.

117
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,891
It's the only song I like.

118
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,095
Just kidding.

119
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,832
Tape's been stuck in the player for,
like, two years.

120
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:06,476
Better than nothing, though.

121
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:08,532
Maybe.

122
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:22,638
I am so... sick...
of this song.

123
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:24,565
Don't worry.
It comes around again.

124
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,206
What do you mean?

125
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:30,547
♪ Just to be the man
who walks 1,000 miles ♪

126
00:06:30,585 --> 00:06:36,194
♪ And falls down
at your door... ♪

127
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,382
Yeah, we totally
nailed the ending.

128
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:41,056
That was probably our best one.

129
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,231
Hey, you want to
play Zitch Dog?

130
00:06:43,307 --> 00:06:44,864
- What?
- Uh, it's a car game.

131
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:48,295
Every time you see a dog, you got to
be the first one to say, "Zitch dog."

132
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,999
- I'm pretty good, so...
- Zitch dog.

133
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,606
Well, no, I didn't know we had...
we'd started, but...

134
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:55,772
Okay, that's cool.
You got the first point.

135
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,079
- Zitch dog.
- Zitch dog. Damn it!

136
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:02,520
Are we still playing?
'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...

137
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,691
12-nothing.

138
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:06,331
Marshall.

139
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:12,614
- Marshall.
- Zitch dog, blue Suburban.

140
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:13,686
Damn it!

141
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:15,242
18-nothing.

142
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:18,769
Then Marshall,
who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog,

143
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:20,202
got us totally lost.

144
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:21,676
Where the hell are we?!

145
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:24,491
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

146
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:26,139
I think you skipped something.

147
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:28,777
Really? Seems impossible.

148
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:32,066
Hey, we got some time.

149
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,294
What do you say we get off the highway,
take the road less traveled, you know?

150
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:38,200
Robert Frost.

151
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:41,055
Doesn't seem like a smart idea.

152
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,131
Too late.

153
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,855
I'm taking this exit.

154
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:47,214
Who's not fun
enough now, Karen?

155
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:51,063
Then we got lost.

156
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,806
Where the hell are we?!

157
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,292
- I'm pulling over.
- No, keep driving.

158
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:58,091
We're almost out of gas, and we
might not even be on a road anymore.

159
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:01,440
It's below zero out. If we pull over,
we could be snowed in for days.

160
00:08:01,474 --> 00:08:04,305
Plus, I only have, like, six granola
bars and three bottles of water.

161
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:05,900
- Nah, I threw them out.
- What?!

162
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:09,358
No food or drink in the Fiero.

163
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:13,898
No food or drink in the F...? You
haven't washed your sheets since...

164
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:16,757
Thus began the longest
night of our lives.

165
00:08:20,812 --> 00:08:24,228
Pretty sure that my
foot is frozen solid.

166
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:26,002
Marshall...

167
00:08:27,118 --> 00:08:30,471
there's a very real chance that we're
gonna be snowed in here for days.

168
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,403
If I die first,
do whatever you need to survive.

169
00:08:34,436 --> 00:08:35,616
Eat my flesh.

170
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:38,180
Slice me open like a
tauntaun, whatever.

171
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:40,356
Thanks, Ted.

172
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:42,632
You're a good friend.

173
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,144
And if I die first,
you just leave my body alone.

174
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:48,138
What?

175
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,362
I just said you could cut me
open and crawl inside me.

176
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,940
Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me;
it skeeves me out.

177
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:56,045
But... but you're dead,
and I'm gonna die if I don't.

178
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:58,083
Wasn't an easy decision.

179
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:02,041
This is all because of
your insane no-food rule.

180
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:04,550
It's perfectly rational.

181
00:09:08,976 --> 00:09:11,354
Hey! My spectacles!

182
00:09:16,743 --> 00:09:17,581
Hey.

183
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,908
I know we're low on gas,

184
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:24,858
but can we turn on the
heat for just a minute?

185
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,687
Okay.

186
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:39,004
Dude...

187
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,621
I hate to say this...

188
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,800
but it's so cold...

189
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:48,770
there's only one way that we're
gonna make it through this night.

190
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,162
- We should've kept driving.
- Come on, Marshall.

191
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,410
No. No. We might die now.

192
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,176
I may never see Lily again.

193
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,313
I never told
anybody this, but...

194
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,051
I've known for a long time that
I'm gonna marry that girl.

195
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:13,992
If we survive this,
someday I'm gonna marry her.

196
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:18,594
I'm sorry about
your spectacles.

197
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,558
That's okay.

198
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,137
They were decorative.

199
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:30,303
Hey, Marshall.

200
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:31,727
Yeah?

201
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:35,024
Are you still
thinking about Lily?

202
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:36,719
Yeah.

203
00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:38,887
Please stop.

204
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:45,873
And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna
die out there in the middle of nowhere.

205
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:48,110
But funny thing...

206
00:10:56,185 --> 00:11:00,462
Hey. You lovers better
just keep on driving.

207
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,360
- Zitch dog!
- Damn it!

208
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:09,071
You said you were gonna
marry me that long ago?

209
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:10,926
That is so sweet.

210
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,635
That trip is when Marshall
and I became best friends.

211
00:11:13,737 --> 00:11:16,222
With privileges,
from the sound of it.

212
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,127
Eriksen.

213
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:41,242
Wow.

214
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:43,681
Looks like he
really needs a hug.

215
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,266
Ted.

216
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:58,206
He said it would be at least
3,000 bucks to make it run again.

217
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,811
And even then,
there's no guarantee.

218
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:02,526
Well, it's a pretty old car.

219
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:05,161
Yeah. You can keep
prolonging its life,

220
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:08,400
but it's really mostly
machine at this point.

221
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:11,978
I know that it's
a lot of money,

222
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:14,474
but it's my Fiero, you know?

223
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,327
I'm about to graduate and take
some sellout corporate law job,

224
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,042
and without that Fiero,
I'm just another guy in a suit.

225
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,665
- How dare you...
- Hey.

226
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:26,217
I've been through so
much in that car.

227
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,811
The suicidal cat.

228
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:33,345
Hitchhiking Waldo.

229
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,649
The homeless guy who broke
in through the window

230
00:12:39,686 --> 00:12:42,115
and threw up all
over the backseat.

231
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:43,270
Lily, don't.

232
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,485
Be strong. Do not go all
"prisoner's dilemma" on me.

233
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,382
The car's on its deathbed, Robin.
I have to clear my conscience.

234
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,856
Guys, what are
you talking about?

235
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,977
Okay. Shortly
after we met Robin,

236
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:57,122
she and I were jonesing for
Thai food from this one place.

237
00:12:57,158 --> 00:13:00,069
An hour and a half delivery.
We can't wait that long.

238
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:04,502
I wish we could take the Fiero, but
Marshall has this insane no-food rule.

239
00:13:04,537 --> 00:13:06,176
But Thai food, Lily.

240
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:07,860
Pad Yum Mao.

241
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:09,684
Tom Kai Gah.

242
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,371
Thai See Ran.

243
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:15,219
Oh! You're just saying random syllables,
and it still sounds delicious.

244
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:17,444
Okay. Here's what we'll do.

245
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:21,035
We'll drive over, pick it up,
have them double-bag it,

246
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:24,854
very carefully drive it back
here with the windows open,

247
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,608
and he'll never know.

248
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:29,123
Wow, these brakes
are really sensitive.

249
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:31,541
Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me!

250
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:34,918
This and the difference between "affect"
and "effect" are the only two things

251
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:36,583
he's really serious about.

252
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:38,459
- Lily, it's gonna be fine.
- No, it's not.

253
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:41,044
Marshall's gonna freak.
Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do?

254
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,309
- Oh, God, oh...!
- Shut up!

255
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:44,494
Now, listen to me.
The clock is ticking.

256
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:48,103
Okay, first thing, we scoop up all
these little pieces of tofu and cabbage.

257
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:50,519
Next, what we need to take care
of are the really messy parts--

258
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:53,235
the pools that have collected.
We got to soak that soup up.

259
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,124
Last is the smell.
We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai.

260
00:13:56,156 --> 00:13:57,367
You mentioned cigars.

261
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:59,600
There's two in the glove compartment,
but he's been saving them.

262
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,197
Hand me those chopsticks.

263
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,471
Hey, how about some tunes?

264
00:14:09,592 --> 00:14:11,953
Oh, great song.

265
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:16,645
These cigars aren't
helping at all.

266
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:19,111
Yeah. This was a terrible idea.

267
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,847
Now it just smells like a
homeless guy threw up in here.

268
00:14:27,256 --> 00:14:28,887
The broken windows?

269
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,491
We had to make it
look realistic.

270
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:32,486
Why did you break two of them?

271
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,113
It looked like fun when she did it.
So I wanted to try.

272
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:39,240
Can't believe this whole
time it was you guys.

273
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,898
I've been blaming really
tanned dancing leotard guy.

274
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:45,417
Marshall, I'm so sorry,
but sharing that secret--

275
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,206
that's when Robin and
I became best friends.

276
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,921
Wow. What a special car.

277
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,155
So, can I crush it into
a little cube yet?

278
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,312
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

279
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:56,676
Come on, Marshall.

280
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:58,250
This is your Fiero.

281
00:14:58,283 --> 00:15:00,283
You know the right
thing to do here.

282
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:02,971
Wow, Barney,
why do you love that car so much?

283
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:04,456
Love it?

284
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:06,310
Hold on a second.

285
00:15:07,138 --> 00:15:08,574
Love it?

286
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,620
I hate it!

287
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:12,915
What? Why?

288
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:15,805
Why? Why?

289
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:17,760
Why?!

290
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,388
- Why?!
- Let me tell it.

291
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:24,254
It was last year during
the transit strike.

292
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:25,605
- Hey.
- Hey.

293
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,928
Uh, is Marshall around?

294
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:29,695
I have a massage in Queens in
half an hour. I need a ride.

295
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,241
Uh, no, he's at the library all day.
Just take the keys.

296
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,981
Hey! Why don't you drive me?

297
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:37,695
It'll be like a
total road trip.

298
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:38,967
To Queens?

299
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:42,427
Yeah, we'll get,
we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.

300
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:45,003
Uh, actually I have a
lot of work to do, so.

301
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,072
Okay. Well, anyway,
I'll cancel.

302
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:49,786
- See you later.
- Wait!

303
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,425
You know how to drive, right?

304
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:57,076
What, of course I know how to drive.
I love driving.

305
00:15:57,482 --> 00:15:58,971
Hitting the road.

306
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:01,244
Cruising the lanes.

307
00:16:01,942 --> 00:16:03,228
And braking.

308
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,195
Honking. Love it.

309
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:07,753
Except for lady drivers.

310
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:10,590
Don't get me started
on lady drivers.

311
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:12,515
- Which pedal's the gas?
- Trick question.

312
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:13,435
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

313
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,672
- No, it's not.
- Middle, left, right?

314
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:19,259
I never learned how to drive!

315
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:21,687
I grew up in the city.
I never had a chance.

316
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:22,738
Well, guess what?

317
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:25,045
You're getting your chance.
Because I'm going to teach you.

318
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,760
Barney Stinson, buckle up.

319
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:31,460
This isn't right.

320
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:34,435
God never meant for us to travel
at such breakneck speeds.

321
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:37,094
Relax. You're doing great.

322
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:40,062
Ignore the old lady on the rascal;
this isn't a race.

323
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,401
Dude, a dog.

324
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,553
Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.

325
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:47,942
What do I do?
Tell me what to do, Ted.

326
00:16:47,977 --> 00:16:50,849
Step on the brakes.
Sometime in the next 20 minutes.

327
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,531
Which? Which one's
the break again?

328
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:54,617
- The left one.
- Left. Oh, man, left.

329
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:56,501
- I'm totally blanking.
- Make the Ls.

330
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:58,317
Oh, we're not going to make it.

331
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:01,605
Why did you just
turn on the radio?

332
00:17:01,742 --> 00:17:03,181
I don't know why I
turned on the radio!

333
00:17:03,214 --> 00:17:05,063
We're going to die.
Tell me what to do, Ted.

334
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,466
Relax. You're being crazy.

335
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:08,745
- Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.
- Stop, drop and roll.

336
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:15,512
Screaming is fun!
Screaming is fun!

337
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,398
I can't move.

338
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:29,306
I can't... I can't feel my...

339
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,008
Wait.

340
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:33,404
Wait.

341
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:38,888
We're okay.

342
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:40,763
- We're okay.
- We're okay.

343
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,050
It's a miracle, Ted!

344
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:48,051
Wow. Sounds like you had
some accident in that car.

345
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:50,540
Actually, he had two accidents
if you add the fact that he...

346
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:57,507
I shouldn't even be here,
thanks to that deathtrap.

347
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,960
But fate...

348
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,507
fate gave me a second chance.

349
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,747
And helped me realize that our days on
this planet are too few to squander.

350
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:08,844
So I decided from
that moment on

351
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,877
to continue living
life to its fullest.

352
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,478
So you made a life-changing decision
to not change your life at all.

353
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:18,871
True story.

354
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:21,217
Guys.

355
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,661
This Fiero's meant
a lot to all of us.

356
00:18:23,697 --> 00:18:25,447
Friendships were made.

357
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:28,163
Adventures had. Horrors faced.

358
00:18:30,213 --> 00:18:31,703
That's why we have
to get rid of it.

359
00:18:31,739 --> 00:18:32,986
- Yes!
- What?

360
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:36,406
It's lived a great life and it
deserves to die with dignity.

361
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:38,038
But 200,000...

362
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,586
But that's life. You know?

363
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,043
You never end up where you
thought you wanted to be.

364
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:44,644
I'm not helping
the environment.

365
00:18:44,682 --> 00:18:46,211
Ted's not a philosopher.

366
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:47,872
Lily's not not a
world-famous artist.

367
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:50,750
Barney's never driven more
than ten miles an hour.

368
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:54,399
Robin, I'm sure, has also experienced
disappointment in her life.

369
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:55,372
Maybe?

370
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:59,485
And my Fiero's not a Fiero
that went 200,000 miles.

371
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:02,771
It's okay. You know?

372
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,706
Those are old dreams.

373
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:09,680
We'll get a new car and we'll fill
that one up with new memories.

374
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:12,615
And that'll be the car we had
when we were first married.

375
00:19:12,671 --> 00:19:14,951
When we owned our first house.

376
00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:17,908
Maybe even the first car
our four kids remember.

377
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,004
That's so sweet.

378
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,813
The first car our
two kids remember.

379
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:26,853
I would like to say good-bye.

380
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,603
You know what?

381
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:48,749
This Fiero,
it's effected all our lives.

382
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:50,010
- Affected.
- That's what I said.

383
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:51,426
Just making sure.

384
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,439
Got us all a lot of places.

385
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:55,734
I mean maybe it's time
we return the favor.

386
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,170
This Fiero should have
made it to 200,000.

387
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:00,108
So, let's get it out that door.

388
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:02,321
And we'll push it
the last .7 miles.

389
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:04,126
It'd do the same for us.

390
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:23,165
Hey, geniuses.

391
00:20:23,198 --> 00:20:26,574
The back wheels are on blocks.
That car ain't going anywhere.

392
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:31,958
- Close enough!
- Close enough!

393
00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:35,255
And so Marshall said
good-bye to his Fiero.

394
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:37,349
And as the car's
final gift to us all,

395
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:41,440
the money he got for scrap parts paid
our bar tab for the next two nights.

396
00:20:41,477 --> 00:20:43,216
Arrivederci, Fiero!

397
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:45,793
You were the freaking
giving tree of cars.

398
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,696
May you rust in peace.

399
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:50,293
Rot in hell, devil steed.

400
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:54,285
And what better friend
is there than that?

401
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,072
Bro. Have you heard
this new song?

402
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:01,617
I just got the cassingle.

403
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:02,788
Put it in.

404
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:09,244
I am never going to
get sick of this song.

405
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:12,344
Never, ever, never,
never, ever.

406
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,137
Yeah!
