1
00:00:00,379 --> 00:00:03,929
Kids, sometimes your relationship
goes so smoothly for so long

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:06,145
that you think it will be
that way forever.

3
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:07,424
It never is.

4
00:00:07,434 --> 00:00:09,744
Well, we just had our first fight.

5
00:00:09,754 --> 00:00:11,193
We had our first fight.

6
00:00:11,203 --> 00:00:12,919
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

7
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:15,872
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

8
00:00:18,963 --> 00:00:21,356
A few months ago,
my architecture firm was approached

9
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:22,584
to design this new building...

10
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:24,839
It's this big skyscraper
in Spokane.

11
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:26,619
It'd be a huge project
for his firm.

12
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,712
And if we don't get it,
we could go under.

13
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:31,762
So anyway, the head architect
unveils his new design

14
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:33,186
to the whole company.

15
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:40,113
- No.
- No.

16
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:41,245
Yes.

17
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,296
All skyscrapers
kind of look like a...

18
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:48,003
Marshall,
it's a 78-story pink marble tower

19
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,581
with a rounded top

20
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:52,496
and two spherical
entryways at the front.

21
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,406
Wow, so it's the whole package.

22
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,467
- Yeah, you did.
- Had to.

23
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:59,163
Oh, dude, if they're selling condos,
you got to get me in.

24
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:00,502
And don't give me the shaft.

25
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:02,355
- Yeah, you did.
- Had to.

26
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:04,375
It's a travesty.

27
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,336
It's gonna define
the skyline of the city.

28
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,881
If it was me, I could've
designed something amazing.

29
00:01:08,895 --> 00:01:11,893
Instead, I'm spending 12 hours
a day designing the cornices.

30
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,656
- Yeah, you did.
- That wasn't one.

31
00:01:15,393 --> 00:01:17,893
Sync by vNaru

32
00:01:27,997 --> 00:01:30,314
So you and Ted
had your first fight.

33
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,997
It obviously ended well.
I mean, you're here with me.

34
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:34,816
Actually,
it didn't end at all.

35
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,919
I started getting bummed out,
so I came here.

36
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:37,921
It's what I do.

37
00:01:37,936 --> 00:01:39,764
When my grandma died,
I got a perm.

38
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:42,806
Ooh, two tragedies in one day.

39
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,150
The thing is,
Ted has been literally

40
00:01:46,163 --> 00:01:48,582
complaining about work
nonstop for weeks.

41
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:52,095
So, when I came over today,
I was kind of done.

42
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,454
- Hey.
- Hey.

43
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,458
- How was your day?
- Good.

44
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,301
Wow, you're a great interviewer.

45
00:01:59,316 --> 00:02:00,550
Aren't you gonna ask
how my day was?

46
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:03,193
No, I know how it was.
It was awful.

47
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:05,505
Ooh, you want to rent
a movie tonight?

48
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:07,149
You know, um...

49
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:09,510
I listen to your work
stories all the time.

50
00:02:09,523 --> 00:02:12,112
Yeah, but...
and I don't want to be rude here,

51
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,723
but my work stories
are interesting.

52
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,796
I'm a television news reporter.

53
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,879
- Robin...
- What?

54
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:20,641
I knew exactly
 what he was going to say.

55
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:23,352
I was just helping him
get there faster.

56
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:26,315
You should work
at a suicide hotline.

57
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:28,465
And then it got ugly.

58
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:32,149
What I don't do is tell you
the same story over and over again.

59
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:34,053
I mean, you wouldn't
watch the same movie

60
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:35,891
over and over again, would you?

61
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,926
Maybe a great movie
like Die Hard.

62
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:40,586
But Field of Dreams?

63
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:42,799
Once is more than enough.

64
00:02:45,876 --> 00:02:47,903
So that's your go-to bad movie?

65
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,907
The number one example
on the tip of your tongue

66
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,689
of a bad movie is
Field of Dreams?

67
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:55,030
It's about
ghost baseball players.

68
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:56,640
I think it's stupid.

69
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:03,940
So, now he's all mad at me
about the stupid movie.

70
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:06,712
Robin, he's upset because
you wouldn't listen to him,

71
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:08,862
not because you didn't like
some movie.

72
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,075
How do you not like
Field of Dreams?!

73
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:16,801
Listening is the foundation
of a relationship.

74
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:18,431
And if he's really droning on,

75
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:20,932
you can always practice
saying the alphabet backwards.

76
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:23,407
You know, in case
you get pulled over for a DUI.

77
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:24,897
I guess I don't know
how to do that.

78
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:27,338
Yeah, it's really hard,
even when you're sober.

79
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:29,310
That's what I tried
to explain to the cop.

80
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:33,104
No, I mean, I guess I don't know
how to do this girlfriend thing.

81
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:36,488
I've never been in a relationship
this serious before.

82
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:40,551
I should probably go tell him
I'm sorry, shouldn't I?

83
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:44,153
You're trying to do it right now,
aren't you?

84
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:46,735
What the hell comes before "Q"?

85
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:51,239
Then at the end of the movie when
he has a catch with his dad, like...

86
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:54,843
like he never did when he was
young enough for it to matter.

87
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:58,147
Can we talk about something else?

88
00:03:58,733 --> 00:03:59,958
You know what, dude?

89
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:02,281
Forget about Robin, okay?
You're hanging with us tonight.

90
00:04:02,297 --> 00:04:04,161
I've got an awome party lined up.

91
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,562
Oh, God.

92
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:09,236
This gonna be another one
of your weird all-guy parties?

93
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,399
That was a poker game.
What is wrong with you?

94
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:14,933
No, it's the first law school
party of the year

95
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:16,483
and it's gonna be awesome.

96
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:18,393
I haven't seen this guys since,
like, last year

97
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,967
before Lily and I broke up.

98
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,270
So I'm gonna have
to break the news to everybody.

99
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:24,239
It's really gonna bum them out.

100
00:04:24,886 --> 00:04:26,802
This party's gonna suck.

101
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,244
Well, love to join you at that one.

102
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,098
But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.

103
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:34,919
I wish I could join you guys,
but I got to get back

104
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:36,993
to my apparently boring job.

105
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:39,532
- Your job's not boring.
- Robin thinks so.

106
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:41,875
Dude, lots of chicks
think architects are hot.

107
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:44,438
Think about it,
you create something out of nothing.

108
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:45,590
You're like God.

109
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:47,630
There's nobody hotter than God.

110
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:49,591
I love it when you quote Scripture.

111
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:53,708
I'm telling you, you should use
the architect angle with the ladies.

112
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,969
Okay, first of all,
I have a girlfriend.

113
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:58,441
Second, the architect angle
doesn't even work on her.

114
00:04:58,456 --> 00:05:01,372
And, third, I can't imagine
that working on anyone ever.

115
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:03,737
That's 'cause you're always like...

116
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:07,057
Ted Mosby, architect.

117
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:09,269
If it were me, I'd be like...

118
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:11,895
Ted Mosby, architect.

119
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,128
Anything sounds impressive when
it's said with the right attitude.

120
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:19,250
Marshall Ericksen.

121
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:21,952
Recently dumped
and heading to a lame party.

122
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:24,605
Whoa. Whoa, ladies,
please take it easy.

123
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,835
There's enough of me for everyone.

124
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:28,278
Oh. Hi. Hello.

125
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,329
All right. We're gonna take off..

126
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:32,290
Wait up, I'll leave with you guys.

127
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:35,814
Ted Mosby, architect.

128
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,477
Trust me.

129
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,889
Hey, just out of curiosity.

130
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:51,617
If a guy told you
he was an architect,

131
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,048
what would you think of that?

132
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:54,212
Are you kidding?

133
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:56,443
Architects are hot.

134
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,828
How do you think Mr. Brady
scored a babe like Carol?

135
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:01,477
Solid point.

136
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:03,440
She did have hair of gold.

137
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:05,413
- Yes, she did.
- Mm-hmm.

138
00:06:09,222 --> 00:06:10,957
Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?

139
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:11,977
No.

140
00:06:11,994 --> 00:06:13,839
Hey, Lily.

141
00:06:13,856 --> 00:06:16,181
- You still single?
- Yes.

142
00:06:16,295 --> 00:06:19,814
You know... I've poured a lot of
free drinks for you over the years.

143
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:21,227
A lot.

144
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:23,627
Carl, do you really want
to be with a woman

145
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,878
who would trade sex for beer?

146
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,821
Only if you're into it.

147
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:30,140
It's on me.

148
00:06:30,152 --> 00:06:31,676
Thanks.

149
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,309
I wonder where Ted went.

150
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:35,889
Ted Mosby, the architect?

151
00:06:36,737 --> 00:06:38,030
Actually, yeah.

152
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:40,213
Oh, he is such a cool guy.

153
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:41,733
He was here earlier.

154
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,117
And what made you decide
you wanted to become an architect?

155
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:47,741
Well, you know, soul of an artist,

156
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:50,063
hands of a master craftsman.

157
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,346
It was inevitable, I guess.

158
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,805
I bet you can draw, can't you?

159
00:06:55,704 --> 00:06:57,298
You should draw me.

160
00:06:57,312 --> 00:07:01,561
Well, I could try, but you might end up
looking like a midcentury tri-level.

161
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:06,516
Hey. If you want, my friend Marshall
invited me to this party we could all go to.

162
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:08,317
Marshall's great.
He's just a lawyer,

163
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,612
but somebody has to push the paper
around for us creative types.

164
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,091
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

165
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:18,029
He asked her to a party.
Oh, my God, are you okay?

166
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,430
Okay? It's awesome.
It's a win-win.

167
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,580
Ted got to vent
and I don't have to hear it.

168
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:24,784
Maybe after he's done with
the talkie-talk, he'll come over

169
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:26,304
and I'll get the fun part.

170
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,088
What is wrong with you?

171
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:32,581
God, I feel like I'm teaching
love as a second language here.

172
00:07:32,596 --> 00:07:35,473
Okay, you know how when
he tells you boring work stories

173
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,926
you're supposed to listen?

174
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:39,896
Well, when he picks up
some random girl at a bar,

175
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:41,557
you're supposed to freak out.

176
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:44,951
I'm not freaking out
because in my mind, she's fat.

177
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:47,744
She's a kickboxing instructor.

178
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,987
Her ass looks better than my face.

179
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,810
All right, we'll swing by the party.

180
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:58,243
Now the party was for
some of Marshall's classmates

181
00:07:58,257 --> 00:08:00,046
from Columbia Law School,

182
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:01,755
who by day were some of the sharpest

183
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,729
and most serious
young legal minds in the country.

184
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:06,683
By night, however...

185
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:11,547
Damn, these are some
drunk almost-lawyers.

186
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,289
Okay! Seriously...

187
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:16,199
who wants to shave my ass?!

188
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:19,492
That guy went on to become
a Supreme Court justice.

189
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:23,054
Okay, where are
the guys and the hooker?

190
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:26,810
Yo, what's up, ladies?
Welcome to the party. Yeah!

191
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:28,820
Just need you to sign
this release protecting the host

192
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,613
from any and all responsibility
should you harm yourself

193
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:31,734
or a third party.

194
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:34,465
Then freakin' rage! Yeah!

195
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:37,489
Hey, drunk legal dude, um...
have you seen Marshall Ericksen?

196
00:08:37,503 --> 00:08:39,040
He was with a guy named Ted.

197
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:41,141
You mean Ted Mosby, the architect?

198
00:08:41,156 --> 00:08:42,795
Man, what a visionary.

199
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,905
Yeah, they were here.

200
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:48,890
Awards are nice,
they look good on my shelf.

201
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:51,420
But none of that acclaim means
anything compared to the joy

202
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:54,643
of seeing the sun rise over
your first building.

203
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,966
Wow.

204
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:58,867
I would love to watch
the sun rise with you.

205
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:00,849
I know you would.

206
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:03,051
It's the job.

207
00:09:03,378 --> 00:09:06,846
Dude. You should let us
shave your ass tonight.

208
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:08,698
No way.

209
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:12,071
Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?

210
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:17,044
I didn't want to ruin the party
for everybody this early, but, uh...

211
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:19,356
everyone take a seat.

212
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:25,942
Um... Lily actually called off
the wedding this summer

213
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:27,944
to go to San Francisco.

214
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,475
So...

215
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:31,517
we're broken up.

216
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:35,120
Her name wasn't on
your lease, was it?

217
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:37,462
'Cause if not, New York state law,
you're not obligated

218
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:39,954
to give her half the deposit
when you move.

219
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,888
Yeah, that's not really the part
I was worried about, guys.

220
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:46,499
And don't forget the precedent set
by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74.

221
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:48,723
Any personal effects she left
in your house or dwelling

222
00:09:48,736 --> 00:09:51,606
become yours after 30 days.

223
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:56,399
Guys, can we cease and desist
with the lawyer speak for a minute?

224
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:58,032
Love died.

225
00:09:58,045 --> 00:10:01,795
The love that made you all believe
in love, that's dead now.

226
00:10:04,581 --> 00:10:05,977
You should sue her.

227
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:07,659
Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?

228
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,841
On the grounds of... shut up.

229
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:15,227
That's our attorney general.

230
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:19,892
See? Marshall's still hung up
on our breakup.

231
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:22,123
Why? Because I listened to him.

232
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:24,816
It was a strong
and nurturing relationship

233
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:27,968
that I threw away like old gum.

234
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:31,312
Not that I'm worried or anything,
but, um, back to the sun rising

235
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:34,852
over Ted and, uh... oh,
what tasteful way did you describe her?

236
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,724
The girl with the smackable ass.

237
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:39,198
Yes, that's the young lady.

238
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:43,942
So, I know the bouncer
at this techno club, Posers.

239
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:45,724
Do you feel like dancing?

240
00:10:45,738 --> 00:10:48,586
Yeah, okay.
There is no way Ted went dancing.

241
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:50,028
Ted hates clubs.

242
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:52,498
Hell, yeah. I love clubs.

243
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:54,780
I mean, I was going to design
a cathedral tonight,

244
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:57,775
kind of take a whack at the whole
relationship between God and man conundrum.

245
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,536
But sure, let's go dancing.

246
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,755
Wait, let me just check
with my friend.

247
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:01,576
Okay.

248
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:04,442
Hey, Marshall. You up for
some super loud, repetitive music

249
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:06,411
that hasn't changed
since the mid-90s?

250
00:11:06,427 --> 00:11:09,066
Um... only always.

251
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,994
Let's go.

252
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:14,740
Dancing?
He went dancing with this girl?

253
00:11:14,886 --> 00:11:16,921
Okay, maybe this is a little bad.

254
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:19,593
Dancing is bad.
Dancing leads to sex.

255
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,885
Did you grow up
in that Footloose town?

256
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,317
I'm calling him.
I'm telling him that I was wrong

257
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,752
and I'm sorry, and I totally want to
listen to his stupid stories.

258
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:31,785
Yeah, think of another way
to phrase that and you'll be fine.

259
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,699
He's not answering.

260
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:36,708
Calling Marshall.

261
00:11:39,137 --> 00:11:40,032
Hello.

262
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,764
Marshall, hi, it's Robin.
Can I talk to Ted?

263
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:44,557
Oh, Robin, hi.

264
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:48,539
Um, no, Ted's not here tonight.
He's, uh... he's working.

265
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:52,243
Uh, okay. Bye.

266
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,695
Marshall just lied.

267
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,248
Ted's cheating on me.

268
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,975
Excuse me. I'm looking for
a couple guys who came in here earlier.

269
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:07,726
One's about six-four, 210,
sandy brown hair.

270
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:10,080
And the other's a cheating bastard.

271
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:12,001
You're going to need
to refresh my memory.

272
00:12:12,015 --> 00:12:16,426
Okay, fella, baby knows
how this game's played.

273
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:19,069
How's a $20 help your memory?

274
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:21,861
Thanks, but seriously,
it was crazy tonight.

275
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:24,530
You really do need
to refresh my memory.

276
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:26,292
Then can I have the...?

277
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,036
That's cool. You keep that.

278
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:30,479
So these guys--
one of them's an architect.

279
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:31,940
Ted Mosby, the architect?

280
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,030
That's the one.

281
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,292
Oh, yeah, he was here.

282
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:39,227
And then I was all, "No, Frank Gehry.
You're on your own this time."

283
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,110
And that, my dear,
was the end of that hack's career.

284
00:12:43,354 --> 00:12:45,651
I live across the street.

285
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,862
That is one hell of a non sequitur.

286
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:49,276
You want to come over?

287
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:51,578
Well, I don't know.

288
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,078
But I suppose I should at least
give you a ride home.

289
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:55,570
Hop on.

290
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,462
I'll see you at book club, Vinny.

291
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,102
- Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudités.
- Nice.

292
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,509
Dude, dude, what are you doing?

293
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:04,989
Galloping.

294
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:08,780
You proved it, all right? The whole
Ted Mosby, architect things works.

295
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:11,004
Architects rule! Whoo-hee!

296
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,905
Aren't you a little worried
that a certain somebody

297
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:14,898
might find out that
you're doing this?

298
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:16,238
This isn't you, Ted.

299
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,120
It is tonight.

300
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:19,891
Whoo!

301
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:24,616
You know this girl.
Where does she live?

302
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,329
I'm not telling you that
for less than 20 bucks.

303
00:13:27,343 --> 00:13:29,640
- Well, I'm out of money.
- I'm cashed, too.

304
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:31,131
I'll take your purse.

305
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:32,041
My purse?

306
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,305
Yeah, my girl likes clutches.

307
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:37,458
Okay, fine.

308
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:41,751
You should tell her that looks
really good with a chocolate boot.

309
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:44,874
Bitch is lucky I brought
my small purse.

310
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:47,237
No room for my gun. Here.

311
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,550
Now where does the rodeo slut live?

312
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:53,041
The building with the green light,
apartment 3-C.

313
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:54,591
Oh, my God, Robin,

314
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:57,275
are you going to kick
this girl's ass?

315
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,677
Yeah...

316
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:00,928
and steal her purse.

317
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,731
I can't believe
he's cheating on me.

318
00:14:05,747 --> 00:14:07,063
You know how many times
I could have cheated?

319
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:08,626
Six... no seven.

320
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:11,209
And you know two of them,
and they would surprise you.

321
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:13,652
3-C, let's do this. You ready?

322
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,190
Should I just kick the door in?

323
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,382
Those are really nice heels
and you already lost the purse.

324
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,317
Let's see if it's unlocked.

325
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,068
It's unlocked.

326
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:26,060
Okay, get in there
and kick some spankable ass.

327
00:14:28,056 --> 00:14:29,834
Robin.

328
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,656
- I'm the problem.
- What?

329
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,998
You were right.

330
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:35,391
I don't know how to be a girlfriend.

331
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:37,173
I took the nicest guy in the world

332
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:38,952
and I made him a cheater.

333
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:41,565
Well, don't stand out here
and beat yourself up.

334
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:43,317
Get in there and beat Ted up.

335
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:45,660
I'll handle the slutty kickboxer.

336
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:47,859
Actually, I'll take Ted.

337
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,854
- Let's do this.
- Bring it.

338
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:13,224
What do you think you're...?

339
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,167
Barney?

340
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,168
Thank God you're here.
Can you help with this? I need nails.

341
00:15:19,434 --> 00:15:22,132
Okay, I'm totally lost here.
Where's Ted?

342
00:15:22,145 --> 00:15:24,014
Ted? He's at work.

343
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,914
How did you get here?

344
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:29,188
Awesome story. As per usual.

345
00:15:29,484 --> 00:15:32,230
How do you think Mr. Brady
scored a babe like Carol?

346
00:15:32,246 --> 00:15:33,581
Solid point.

347
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:36,506
- And she did have hair of gold.
- Yes, she did.

348
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,618
Sorry, I forgot my binocs
for Foxy Boxing.

349
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,868
Whoo, looks like things just got
a little foxier right here.

350
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:43,540
Yes, they did.
And you're just in time.

351
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:47,544
Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you
in very good, if slightly sullied hands.

352
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,547
Don't go. We don't even know your name
to look out for your buildings.

353
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:52,630
Yeah, stay.

354
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:55,613
Excuse us for one second.

355
00:15:56,397 --> 00:15:59,624
Okay, you were right--
the architect thing totally works.

356
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:02,397
But I've got a girlfriend
and I've got to get back to work.

357
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:05,061
This project is getting
harder and harder.

358
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:07,194
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, had to.

359
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:08,454
See ya.

360
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:13,108
Sorry, my, uh...
intern had to leave.

361
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, well, that's too bad.

362
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,100
I'm Anna, by the way.

363
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:22,024
Ted Mosby... architect.

364
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:26,220
But none of that acclaim means
anything compared to the joy

365
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:29,782
of seeing the sun rise
over your first building.

366
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:34,565
- Dude, dude, what are you doing?
- Galloping.

367
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:39,049
All right, you proved it. The whole
Ted Mosby, architect thing works.

368
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,283
Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.

369
00:16:41,296 --> 00:16:44,436
Aren't you afraid a certain somebody
might find out about this?

370
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:46,486
I mean, this isn't you, Ted.

371
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:48,529
It is tonight.

372
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:51,432
And that led to a couple of hours

373
00:16:51,446 --> 00:16:55,404
that I cannot, as a gentleman,
divulge to you.

374
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,360
We did it right here,
and here and here.

375
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:02,462
But why would you use
Ted's name?

376
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:04,833
I've had some recent bad press
on the World Wide Web.

377
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,737
So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole
"using my real name" thing.

378
00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:13,133
Oh, this is great.
It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.

379
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:15,105
Everything isn't okay.

380
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:19,478
Look at me. I'm acting crazy
and jealous and paranoid.

381
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:22,268
This is how people act
in relationships.

382
00:17:22,284 --> 00:17:25,153
And that's why
I avoid relationships.

383
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:27,003
Well, guess what,

384
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:30,227
I haven't been crazy or jealous
or paranoid in months,

385
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:33,531
and I really miss it.

386
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:36,513
And thus ended this chapter of,
"Let's pour our hearts out

387
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:38,836
in the bedroom of Barney's
one-night stand."

388
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,818
Come on, let's go before
she gets out of the shower.

389
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,349
You're such a pig.
You're not even going to say good-bye?

390
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:47,062
I'll have you know
I composed a lovely form letter

391
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:49,494
for use in just such an occasion.

392
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,655
Just fill out her name and then...

393
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:55,579
Something with a "A."

394
00:17:55,594 --> 00:17:58,251
A... A...

395
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:01,224
I'll just put "resident."

396
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:05,520
Go, go, go, go.

397
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,615
Robin took a long walk that night.

398
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:16,317
She thought about how opening
yourself up to another person

399
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:19,682
usually means opening yourself up
to going a little crazy.

400
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:23,494
She thought about how much easier
it was just to be alone.

401
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,368
And then she came to see me.

402
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:30,841
♪ And I am nothing of a builder ♪

403
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:35,807
♪ But here I dreamt I was an architect... ♪
Hey.

404
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:37,577
Hey.

405
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:40,549
- What are you doing here?
- I brought donuts.

406
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:43,342
And I don't want to brag,
but they're filled with jelly.

407
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,313
Thanks.

408
00:18:47,763 --> 00:18:50,640
So, uh... how was your night?

409
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:53,902
It was... fine. Nothing exciting.

410
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,332
How was yours?

411
00:18:57,328 --> 00:19:00,167
You really want to hear about
boring architect stuff?

412
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,179
Yes, I do.

413
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:04,970
I'm sorry about earlier.

414
00:19:05,428 --> 00:19:08,114
To tell you the truth, I never
even saw all of Field of Dreams.

415
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:10,547
I fell asleep half way through.

416
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:12,760
What? The best part's
the last 20 minutes.

417
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:15,441
Well, maybe they should have moved that
part up a little bit earlier, 'cause...

418
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:17,515
You know what, um...

419
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:20,476
What I'm trying to say is...

420
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:23,819
I love being the person
you bitch to.

421
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:28,934
So how was your day,
Mr. Architect?

422
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,406
Oh, I like the way
you say that.

423
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,239
Hey, you want to see
the building

424
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:36,470
that will make every man
in Spokane feel inadequate?

425
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:38,172
Obviously.

426
00:19:39,226 --> 00:19:40,875
- Wow.
- Yeah.

427
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:43,166
You know, you didn't mention
all the foliage around the base.

428
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:45,059
If you trim that back,
the rest would look bigger.

429
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:47,289
You don't have to tell me.

430
00:19:48,776 --> 00:19:52,555
And, um... just for fun, I've...

431
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:56,439
I've sort of been working on my own idea
of what I think the building should be.

432
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:02,733
What do you think?

433
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:07,526
You know that time we went to Spokane
and I pointed out that skyscraper?

434
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:10,319
That was the first building
I ever designed.

435
00:20:10,337 --> 00:20:14,846
And that night was the first time
I showed anyone my first drawing of it.

436
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,868
Wow.

437
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:19,799
Ted, this is amazing.

438
00:20:19,814 --> 00:20:21,732
Thanks.

439
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,686
It's not like it will ever
come to anything.

440
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:27,456
I don't know.

441
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:29,919
It might come to something.

442
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:35,093
You know, girls find
architects very hot.

443
00:20:38,753 --> 00:20:40,716
Okay,

444
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:45,133
but I don't want you expecting
78 stories or anything.

445
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,337
"Dear Resident...

446
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:56,271
The time we spent together,
however long it was,

447
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:58,141
meant the world to me.

448
00:20:58,155 --> 00:21:01,074
I would love to see you again,
but unfortunately, I cannot.

449
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,569
You see, I am a ghost.

450
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:07,490
I can't only materialize
once every decade

451
00:21:07,505 --> 00:21:10,012
on the anniversary of my death.

452
00:21:10,026 --> 00:21:13,167
I chose to spend my one day among
the living with you,

453
00:21:13,182 --> 00:21:15,229
sweet... Resident.

454
00:21:15,243 --> 00:21:18,148
Perhaps we will meet again
in another decade,

455
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,470
provided you keep your figure.

456
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:24,013
Until then, all my love
from the beyond.

457
00:21:24,028 --> 00:21:25,746
Barney."

458
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:28,360
Barney?

459
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:32,072
Who the hell is Barney?
