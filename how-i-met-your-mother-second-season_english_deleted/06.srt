1
00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:03,371
to discover you still don't
have life quite figured out.

2
00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:04,948
Like with Aunt Lily.

3
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:07,061
Even though she was back
from San Francisco,

4
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:09,127
she was still on a
quest to find herself.

5
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:12,278
It's just that all I've ever
done is teach kindergarten.

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,707
I want to get out there
and change the world.

7
00:00:14,717 --> 00:00:17,269
I want to find my passion.

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,943
And she did find it.

9
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:20,702
I'm going to be a life coach.

10
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:22,860
In fact,
she found it again and again.

11
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:25,511
I'm going to be a
marine biologist.

12
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:28,837
...slam poet.
...beekeeper!

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,660
Not a beekeeper.

14
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:34,540
Her newest lifelong dream?

15
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,669
Singing in a punk rock band.

16
00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:38,452
What is she doing for
money through all this?

17
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:40,790
Oh, she's been waiting
tables at Big Wave Luau.

18
00:00:40,804 --> 00:00:42,388
Wait, you mean that
Hawaiian place

19
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:44,608
where they wear those
embarrassing outfits?

20
00:00:44,993 --> 00:00:46,421
No.

21
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:50,309
Here she comes. Here she comes.

22
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:54,156
Welcome to Big Wave Luau.
May I tiki your drink order?

23
00:00:54,174 --> 00:00:55,656
Aw, crap.

24
00:00:55,674 --> 00:00:56,988
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:59,079
Oh, hi, Lily.
We were just in the neighborhood,

26
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,796
thought we'd get some lunch.
We didn't even know you'd be here.

27
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,206
What do you want?

28
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:08,155
Oh, I don't think that's
how you're supposed to greet

29
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:11,175
a customer at Big Wave Luau.

30
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:16,644
Aloha, island visitors.

31
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:20,242
The big wave brought
you to our humble luau.

32
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:24,244
For that, we thank you.
Or in my native tongue, mahalo.

33
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:28,222
I didn't catch your name.
Did you guys catch her name?

34
00:01:28,237 --> 00:01:29,643
No.

35
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,682
My name is Anuhea.

36
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:33,703
It means cool and fragrant,

37
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:36,750
much like any of our
12 specialty drinks.

38
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,122
Robin, nothing to add?

39
00:01:39,137 --> 00:01:41,939
No. Lily is my friend and I'm
not going to make fun of her

40
00:01:41,955 --> 00:01:43,469
for trying to
follow her dreams.

41
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:45,079
Thank you.

42
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:47,609
Although, you might want to
bring out the big Hawaiian drum

43
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,150
because I'm pretty sure
today's my birthday.

44
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:50,898
Birthday girl!

45
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,070
Sync by vNaru

46
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:08,935
I have never needed beer
more than I do right now.

47
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:11,154
I thought you said your semester
was gonna be a piece of cake.

48
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:13,543
I remember because you were eating
a piece of cake at the time

49
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:16,543
and you said, "Dude,
my semester is gonna be this."

50
00:02:16,558 --> 00:02:17,803
Yeah, well,
it was supposed to be,

51
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,603
but my professor's like the
toughest grader I've ever seen.

52
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:22,513
She had like a bad
divorce this summer

53
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:24,451
and now she's taking
it out on us.

54
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:26,723
To tell you the truth,
I think she just needs to get laid.

55
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:27,871
Really?

56
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:29,421
Laid, you say?

57
00:02:29,436 --> 00:02:32,310
You wouldn't be into her.
She's, like, in her late 40s.

58
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:33,682
She hot?

59
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,552
Yeah, I guess she's
kind of hot, yeah.

60
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:37,020
And she's looking
for some action.

61
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:40,368
Sounds to me like she
could be a cougar.

62
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:42,150
- A what?
- A cougar.

63
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:44,720
An older woman,
usually in her 40s or 50s,

64
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:48,018
single and on the prowl
for a younger man.

65
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:51,259
What's a woman in her 60s or 70s--
a turtle?

66
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:54,738
Marshall, I've thought it over
and I accept your challenge.

67
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:58,679
- I didn't challenge you to have sex...
- Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.

68
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:01,747
So, I quit my job.

69
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,448
I just couldn't
take it anymore.

70
00:03:03,463 --> 00:03:07,137
Approximately 50 times a day,
some guy asks me for a lei...

71
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,697
Classic.

72
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,006
Ted, didn't you tell me they need
a new assistant in your office?

73
00:03:12,282 --> 00:03:13,473
Yeah.

74
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:15,603
Somebody did just quit.

75
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:18,105
So, where should we eat today?

76
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:23,375
Oh awesome,
you brought lunch for everyone?

77
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:31,723
Dude, that is cold-blooded.

78
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,492
It was an honest mistake.

79
00:03:33,507 --> 00:03:36,481
Look, when somebody opens up a
container with an entire chicken in it,

80
00:03:36,495 --> 00:03:39,112
it's okay to assume they
made lunch for everyone.

81
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:41,601
Ted, that girl didn't quit.
You destroyed her.

82
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:44,299
It was an whole chicken.

83
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:45,881
And did I mention
she had 12 sides?

84
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,099
Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure.
Real classy, Ted.

85
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:51,588
So, Lily, what do you say?
Do you want the job?

86
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:53,097
What would I be doing?

87
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:55,699
Basically, you're sort of
a general office assistant.

88
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:58,617
You'll sit there.
My station is right over here.

89
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:00,296
And things are a little
bit crazy right now

90
00:04:00,332 --> 00:04:02,398
'cause we're pitching a new
building to a big client.

91
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,608
- Oh, right, is that the...
- Yeah.

92
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:06,255
Here's the model.

93
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,277
You weren't kidding.
It really does look like a giant penis.

94
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,345
I know.

95
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:15,964
For whatever reason, Mr.
Druthers just doesn't see it.

96
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:17,466
How can he not see it?

97
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:18,896
- I mean there's the...
- I know.

98
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:20,433
- And the way it...
- I know.

99
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:22,884
- And the two little...
- I know.

100
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:26,053
- Wow, it is just...
- Spectacular?

101
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:27,454
Why, thank you.

102
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:29,973
Lily, this is Mr. Druthers,
the head architect on the project.

103
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:31,893
Lily's going to be our
new office assistant.

104
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:33,893
- Ah.
- Nice to meet you.

105
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,382
Isn't it?

106
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:38,291
Ted, I looked at your design
for the penthouse balcony.

107
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:41,641
Tell me,
do you want to be an architect?

108
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:44,580
I, uh... I am an architect.

109
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:45,822
Really?

110
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:48,749
Well, my six-year-old
nephew plays with Legos.

111
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:51,010
Is he an architect?

112
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:55,309
Well, not unless he somehow
passed all his licensing exams.

113
00:04:55,323 --> 00:04:57,520
Ted, you've got promise.

114
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:59,989
But you have to study
what I do more carefully.

115
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:03,677
Now I want you to design
some Styrofoam trees

116
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,446
for the building model.

117
00:05:05,463 --> 00:05:07,538
- Think you can handle that?
- Absolutely.

118
00:05:07,553 --> 00:05:11,525
Good. So you're going
to design the...

119
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:14,575
- Styrofoam trees.
- Once again-- with feeling.

120
00:05:15,473 --> 00:05:18,635
- Styrofoam trees.
- Styrofoam trees!

121
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,725
- Styrofoam trees!
- That's the spirit.

122
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:22,375
Now, gather 'round.

123
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,703
This isn't just about trees, Ted.
This is about life.

124
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:33,502
And sometimes in life,
you have to get the trees just right

125
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:35,403
or you're fired, hmm?

126
00:05:39,596 --> 00:05:42,941
Man, that guy is
a total, well...

127
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:49,781
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
That's Professor Lewis's office there.

128
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:52,081
Okay, let's take a look.

129
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:58,611
Oh, yeah,
it's a cougar all right.

130
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:00,840
A prime specimen.

131
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:05,688
See, you can identify a cougar
by a few key characteristics.

132
00:06:05,704 --> 00:06:07,288
Start with the hair.

133
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:09,627
The cougar keeps up
with current hairstyles

134
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:11,837
as a form of camouflage.

135
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:14,728
The prey may not realize
that he's engaged a cougar

136
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:17,246
until he's already
being dragged, helpless,

137
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:18,835
back to her lair.

138
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:21,286
Now, the blouse.

139
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:24,255
The cougar displays
maximum cleavage possible

140
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:26,605
to captivate her prey.

141
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:28,814
If you're watching them bounce,

142
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:31,094
she's about to pounce.

143
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,143
See the claws?

144
00:06:33,156 --> 00:06:35,771
Long and sharp,

145
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:38,192
to ward off rival females...

146
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:40,659
or open alimony checks.

147
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:45,092
Yeah, this one's a beaut.

148
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:51,451
Okay, let the hunt begin.

149
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:53,632
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm not so sure I'm comfortable

150
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,652
with you hunting my
constitutional law professor.

151
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,531
Who do you rather have
grading your papers--

152
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:03,371
a savage,
man-eating jungle cat,

153
00:07:03,384 --> 00:07:07,270
or a purring, satisfied kitty?

154
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:11,277
Go, Barney.

155
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:14,418
Go mount and stuff that cougar.

156
00:07:17,164 --> 00:07:21,937
Scusi, I am Luigi,
Italian exchange student.

157
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,666
I was, uh, walking to class,

158
00:07:25,683 --> 00:07:28,585
but then I noticed you...

159
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:30,885
bella principessa...

160
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:33,305
Tell me what you
want or get out.

161
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:34,696
Direct.

162
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:36,335
I like that.

163
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:37,945
The name's Barney.

164
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,343
What I want... is you.

165
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:45,804
Turn around.

166
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:50,312
My place. Two hours.

167
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,643
Don't be tardy.

168
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:57,960
I can't believe how Mr.
Druthers treats people.

169
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,329
And that building?
Talk about overcompensating.

170
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,762
He's not usually this bad.

171
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:04,312
It's just that the partners
have made it very clear

172
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:06,190
this project is make
or break for us,

173
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:08,498
so lately he's been
a little testy.

174
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:11,910
You know what I
mean-- crotchety.

175
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:15,537
I'm just saying it's
been hard on him.

176
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:17,328
All right stop.

177
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:20,177
- Did you show Lily your design?
- No.

178
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:21,768
- What design?
- It's nothing.

179
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:23,147
It's fantastic.

180
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:25,559
Just for fun,
Ted's been working on his own design.

181
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:28,098
And it doesn't look at
all like male genitalia.

182
00:08:28,113 --> 00:08:30,847
At least,
not healthy male genitalia.

183
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,274
Ted, you should pitch your
building to Druthers.

184
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,625
Are you kidding?
He's Hammond Druthers.

185
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,176
He's a legend.
I'm just part of his team.

186
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,533
This building is
huge for the firm,

187
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:41,865
so it's really important
we don't blow it.

188
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:44,244
All right, enough.

189
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,115
Oh, my God. Incredible.

190
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:52,073
Hmm... C-minus.

191
00:08:53,177 --> 00:08:55,892
C-minus? What are
you talking about?

192
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:58,403
I just pulled an all-nighter!

193
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:00,812
You didn't budget
your time well,

194
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:03,750
you glossed over some of
the most important points,

195
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:07,060
and your oral presentation
was sloppy and inconclusive.

196
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:12,112
Mr. Druthers asked if
you were making the trees

197
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:14,791
or waiting for them to
sprout on their own.

198
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:18,481
Then he stared at
me until I laughed.

199
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:20,670
Okay, I'm done.

200
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:22,979
Great. I'll put the paints away.
You just go show him.

201
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:24,599
Great. Thanks.

202
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:28,126
Well, finally.

203
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:30,767
I wondered whether you
were making the trees

204
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:33,845
or waiting for them to
sprout on their own.

205
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:38,286
Good one, sir.

206
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,494
Anyway, here they are.

207
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:45,276
- Too green.
- Too green?

208
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:48,255
Yes, the leaves should really be
more of a natural brown color.

209
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:49,615
Almost brunette.

210
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:53,824
And think bushier.
I want this tower to rise

211
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,971
from a thicket of wild,
ungroomed, brunette shrubbery.

212
00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:00,024
Can you picture it, Ted?

213
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:02,321
I can't un-picture it.

214
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,072
Good.

215
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:06,911
Oh, my God.

216
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:08,012
It's gone!

217
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:09,702
What? What's gone?

218
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:13,510
My baseball signed three
times by Pete Rose.

219
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,099
Well, it's got to be
around here somewhere.

220
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:17,390
What do you think, Ted,

221
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:21,161
it just let itself out of its
plastic case and rolled away?

222
00:10:21,174 --> 00:10:23,151
Somebody stole it.

223
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,269
Well, um, I better get back
to these Styrofoam trees.

224
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:28,348
Oh, who cares about the trees?

225
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:31,868
It's just busy work to make you
feel like you're contributing.

226
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:34,188
Inspiring as always, sir.

227
00:10:35,563 --> 00:10:37,068
Lily?

228
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:41,668
Where's she put those paints?

229
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:57,423
Hey.

230
00:10:57,437 --> 00:11:01,124
Hey. Um, Lily,
question for you.

231
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,105
Why did I find
Mr. Druthers' baseball

232
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:06,003
signed three times by Pete
Rose in your desk drawer?

233
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:07,922
That's easy. I took it.

234
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:08,922
Why?

235
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:10,641
It's simple.

236
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:14,243
I can't believe there's no
horseradish for the roast beef.

237
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:18,552
I guess you were sick the day they
taught that at Sandwich University.

238
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:26,250
Mother, no one from the nursing
home is stealing from you.

239
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:29,211
I didn't get you a
birthday present.

240
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:38,129
What? You gonna cry?

241
00:11:38,593 --> 00:11:40,818
Little crybaby's going to cry?

242
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:42,338
Hey, everybody, look!

243
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:45,658
The little crybaby's gonna cry!

244
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,295
I lost my ice cream!

245
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:53,600
Okay, I may have
exaggerated that last one,

246
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:56,402
but the point is, he was mean.

247
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:58,739
And that's why I
took away his ball.

248
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,052
What does his ball have
to do with anything?

249
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:04,009
Druthers has to be taught
he can't behave like that.

250
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,919
When I was teaching kindergarten,
whenever a kid was mean,

251
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:08,970
I would take away
one of his toys.

252
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:10,868
The kid would be
upset at first,

253
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:13,567
but then he'd learn
to stop being mean.

254
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:15,186
Hey, guys. What's going on?

255
00:12:15,203 --> 00:12:18,208
Lily stole my boss' baseball
signed three times by Pete Rose.

256
00:12:18,224 --> 00:12:19,939
Why? Was he being mean?

257
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:21,507
- You know about this?
- Yeah.

258
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,818
It's her own personal
form of justice.

259
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,598
Did you tell him about
that time at the Gap?

260
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,817
Oh, that was a good one.

261
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,777
This sales guy
was rude to Robin,

262
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,347
so I took a pair of khakis.

263
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:32,364
I gave them to you
for your birthday.

264
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:34,557
So I've been walking
around in stolen khakis?

265
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,335
I prefer to call them
"justice khakis."

266
00:12:37,349 --> 00:12:40,054
That's not justice.
It's shoplifting, and it's a crime.

267
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:41,895
So is being mean.

268
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,065
Lily, your little system
doesn't even make sense.

269
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,252
In kindergarten,
the kid knew why he was being punished.

270
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:48,454
Druthers just thinks
someone stole his ball.

271
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,282
Well, that's why I left a note.

272
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:51,783
- A note?
- Yeah.

273
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:54,671
When he finds it, he'll understand
why his ball was taken away,

274
00:12:54,685 --> 00:12:56,223
he'll stop being mean,

275
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,760
and the office will be
a nicer place to work.

276
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,711
Maybe he'll even be open
to hearing your ideas.

277
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,801
Look, Lil, we're all tolerating

278
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:06,600
this prolonged nervous
breakdown you're clearly having,

279
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:09,698
with the punk band and the
beekeeping and the petty larceny,

280
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:12,150
but this is my career
you're messing with.

281
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:14,467
I'm not sure I like your tone.

282
00:13:14,484 --> 00:13:16,048
You know what?

283
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:18,210
Now you just lost the ball.

284
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:22,827
Hey.

285
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:25,977
I'd ask you how last night went,
but we had a pop quiz today.

286
00:13:25,992 --> 00:13:27,926
Nobody got higher
than a C-minus.

287
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,748
I know, I know.

288
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:31,268
You claim to have so much sex.

289
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,418
I only assumed
you'd be good at it.

290
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:35,767
Look, I miscalculated.

291
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:39,536
I thought she'd be old and fragile,
like most cougars.

292
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,725
But kitty's got claws.

293
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,486
Don't worry though.

294
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:44,855
Tonight, I'm seeing her again.

295
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:47,162
Just let it go, man.
You're making things worse.

296
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,722
I promise you, after tonight,
that cougar will be my pet,

297
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,442
and I its master.

298
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:56,931
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

299
00:13:57,598 --> 00:14:00,682
Oh, God.
That wasn't your first time, was it?

300
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:04,291
Although that would
explain a lot.

301
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:07,761
What? No. We had sex yesterday.

302
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:10,509
Oh, right. That.

303
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:13,889
Well, you had sex yesterday.

304
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:16,800
I revised my syllabus
for the spring semester.

305
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,770
When Druthers goes
to get his bagel,

306
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:24,199
I'll go in, grab the note,
put the ball back.

307
00:14:24,215 --> 00:14:25,828
If something goes wrong,

308
00:14:25,843 --> 00:14:28,349
yell out, "Who wants espresso?"

309
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:30,409
so I'll know he's coming.
Got it?

310
00:14:30,423 --> 00:14:31,818
Okay, now give me the ball.

311
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,948
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

312
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:36,368
I mean I stand by
what I did, Ted.

313
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:38,595
Come on, Lily.
We're running out of time.

314
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:41,537
Everybody get in here now!

315
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:44,267
Who wants espresso?

316
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,524
Now, as most of you know,

317
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,264
my Pete Rose, Pete Rose,
Pete Rose baseball has been stolen.

318
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:56,815
Well, I just found this note.

319
00:14:56,828 --> 00:15:01,453
"Dear Mr.
Druthers, I, your baseball, am leaving.

320
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,773
Maybe, if you start being nice,
I'll come back.

321
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:07,042
If not, other things in your
office may follow my lead.

322
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:09,922
In fact,
I overheard your iPod talking,

323
00:15:09,936 --> 00:15:13,309
and he may shuffle
off at any minute."

324
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:17,642
Normally, I would scream at
everyone until my voice goes,

325
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:21,261
but maybe that's the
wrong reaction here.

326
00:15:21,276 --> 00:15:22,640
Interesting.

327
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:26,380
Instead, I'm giving my baseball
until the end of the day

328
00:15:26,395 --> 00:15:28,880
to decide he's homesick,

329
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:32,119
or, tomorrow morning,
I'll begin firing three people an hour.

330
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:36,087
And, if the thief
doesn't believe me, well,

331
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:39,207
then you are gambling
more than Pete Rose--

332
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:41,107
major league baseball's
all-time hit leader,

333
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,685
a man whose absence from the
Hall of Fame is a travesty

334
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,444
to the entire sports world--
ever "allegedly" did!

335
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,106
Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.

336
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:57,823
Give him his ball
back right now.

337
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:59,274
People are going to get fired.

338
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:02,223
No, they're not.
It's just a tantrum, Ted.

339
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,404
I saw this in kindergarten
all the time.

340
00:16:04,418 --> 00:16:05,891
This isn't kindergarten.

341
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:09,292
Mr. Druthers is an adult,
and he wants his ball back.

342
00:16:09,307 --> 00:16:12,580
All right, I'll give it back
if you show him your plans.

343
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:14,761
No. You'll give it
back or you're fired.

344
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:16,303
I'm sorry, Ted.
I just can't do that.

345
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:18,519
Then you're fired.

346
00:16:19,037 --> 00:16:20,959
Fine.

347
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:24,118
Here's the ball.

348
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:26,160
At least you have one now.

349
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:32,570
Dude, you're killing me.

350
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:36,227
You didn't tame the cougar.
You just made her angrier.

351
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:39,886
Do you not see the
PowerBar in my hand?

352
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:41,779
I'm fueling up.

353
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,748
So you're going
back over there?

354
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:44,875
Oh, yeah.

355
00:16:44,893 --> 00:16:47,628
And tonight,
just like John Mellencamp,

356
00:16:47,643 --> 00:16:51,365
I am going to get rid of the
"Cougar" once and for all.

357
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:53,114
Get it?

358
00:16:53,132 --> 00:16:55,566
'Cause that's what he
did with his name.

359
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:08,164
I can't stop
thinking about you.

360
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:10,131
Please give me another chance.

361
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:11,564
Barney, I teach all day.

362
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:14,241
It's the last thing I want
to do when I get home.

363
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:17,411
But you don't understand.
See, I've been going easy on you,

364
00:17:17,428 --> 00:17:20,612
holding back, 'cause I was afraid
you'd break a hip or something.

365
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:22,859
But, this time, no mercy.
I don't care how long it takes--

366
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:26,961
days, weeks, half a year.

367
00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:30,119
Fine. Come in.

368
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:33,190
You can start while I
finish grading some papers.

369
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:38,107
Hurry up.
Clients will be here any moment.

370
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:40,679
Now, slide it closer
to his chair.

371
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:44,288
I want this thing to really
smack him in the face.

372
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:47,779
Mr. Druthers, thank you again
for understanding about Lily.

373
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,088
Oh. Well, I pity her.

374
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,977
I mean, to steal from my office and
then write that slanderous note...

375
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:57,946
You might say that Lily
was mentally deranged.

376
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:00,557
You might say that, Ted.

377
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:05,155
Lily was mentally deranged.

378
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:09,424
You might even say it loud
enough for everyone to hear.

379
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,615
Lily was mentally deranged!

380
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:16,973
Oh! That's a bit harsh,
don't you think, Ted?

381
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:19,223
The clients are here.

382
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:20,931
Excellent. Bring them in.

383
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:25,310
Our client was a major bank and
financial services company in Spokane.

384
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:27,660
They wanted a modern
skyscraper that still captured

385
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:30,611
the distinct flavor and
history of the Northwest.

386
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,442
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you

387
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:37,169
the Spokane National
Bank Building.

388
00:18:39,726 --> 00:18:42,157
That's a penis!

389
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,369
That's... that's ridiculous.

390
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:49,386
There's no way this majestic
tower can be confused

391
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:52,129
with the male organ of love.

392
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:54,337
We're not building a penis.

393
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:56,987
You got any other ideas?

394
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,626
Other ideas?

395
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:01,774
You said you wanted
Hammond Druthers.

396
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:04,487
This is Hammond Druthers.

397
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:07,394
Well, hats off to
your ladyfriends,

398
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,743
but I'm not building it.

399
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:11,923
We're done here.

400
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,162
The trajectory of my entire
career might have been different

401
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:19,142
had I not unwittingly worn
my justice khakis that day.

402
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,711
Wait!

403
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:23,954
We have one more idea for you.

404
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:25,833
Ted, what are you doing?

405
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:27,293
I have another design.

406
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:29,600
Sit down, shut up right now.

407
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:30,970
No.

408
00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:34,940
♪ Thank you for the invitation ♪

409
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:37,651
♪ She showed me very nice... ♪

410
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:40,488
To Ted! The youngest person
to ever design a building

411
00:19:40,506 --> 00:19:43,370
over 70 stories probably!

412
00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:45,829
Probably!

413
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:48,120
Congrats, Ted.

414
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:50,759
Hey, thanks for telling me
to stand up to Druthers

415
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:52,340
and pitch my idea.

416
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:55,068
Seriously, none of this would have
happened if it weren't for you.

417
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:57,388
Oh. You know what, Ted?

418
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,886
That was very nice.

419
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:01,745
You have earned
these screws back.

420
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:05,135
Don't sit in your desk chair
until you've put them back in.

421
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:07,956
Hey, I'm project manager now,

422
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,177
so, if you want your
old job back...

423
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:11,707
No, thanks.

424
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:15,514
I think I figured out what
I want to be when I grow up.

425
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:21,722
Casey, that's not
how we treat people.

426
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,052
You'll get this back when
you learn to be nice.

427
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,224
- Barney! Oh, my God!
- What happened?

428
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:43,342
He broke his hip.

429
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:47,091
That's not true.
It's just temporarily dislocated.

430
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:48,265
Seriously, I'm fine.

431
00:20:48,283 --> 00:20:50,446
No, he's not fine.

432
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:52,255
Professor Lewis, hi.

433
00:20:52,272 --> 00:20:55,656
Mr. Eriksen. Hello.
I graded your paper tonight.

434
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,864
I was pleasantly surprised.

435
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,114
Yeah, she was.

436
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,134
B-plus.

437
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:04,582
B-plus?!

438
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:08,245
Marshall, after I've gone through
my eight weeks of physical therapy,

439
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:10,773
I am going to get you that "A"!

440
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:12,644
Let her go.

441
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:16,301
She belongs out
there in the wild.

442
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,170
You should feel proud.

443
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:21,591
You fought the
cougar and lived.

444
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:24,351
It was an amazing safari.

445
00:21:24,364 --> 00:21:27,741
I can't wait to show
you guys the slides.
