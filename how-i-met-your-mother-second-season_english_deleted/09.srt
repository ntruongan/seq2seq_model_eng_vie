1
00:00:01,814 --> 00:00:03,995
..learn about relationships
is that you're never done

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:05,382
getting to know someone.

3
00:00:05,392 --> 00:00:07,132
Everyone has secrets.

4
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:08,422
Some are nice.

5
00:00:08,432 --> 00:00:10,580
You know how to make crepes?

6
00:00:11,398 --> 00:00:13,070
That is so cool.

7
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:16,672
Some aren't as nice.

8
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:19,057
And then there was Derek,
and counting you,

9
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:21,939
- that puts the total up to--
- Oh, I got your total.

10
00:00:22,403 --> 00:00:23,826
I've been counting along.

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,634
And some are just weird.

12
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:30,125
You're scared of
the seven dwarfs?

13
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:31,781
Just Doc. He's creepy.

14
00:00:31,793 --> 00:00:33,647
I mean the guy went
to medical school.

15
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:36,065
What's he doing living
with six coal miners?

16
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:38,746
Oh, man! I'm so excited.
I couldn't sleep last night.

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,666
- I bet you guys couldn't either.
- Why?

18
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,625
Only the Gala event
for the Grand Opening

19
00:00:42,637 --> 00:00:45,484
of Sharper Image's 500th store.
Didn't you get my email?

20
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:47,994
No, I blocked your address
after the fourth time

21
00:00:48,008 --> 00:00:51,442
you sent me the video of the
monkey sniffing his own butt.

22
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,961
Come on! It's on me.
I'm buying three of you foot massagers

23
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:56,561
and one of you a nose hair trimmer.
You know who you are.

24
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:58,021
Come on, let's go.

25
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,001
Okay, I'm in.

26
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:01,309
- To the Willowbrook Mall!
- To the Willowbrook Mall.

27
00:01:01,326 --> 00:01:04,258
Oh, it's at a mall?
I'm not going.

28
00:01:04,275 --> 00:01:05,511
What? Why not?

29
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,619
I just don't feel
like going to a mall.

30
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,549
We can split a Cinnabon.

31
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:11,358
No, I'm really not going to go.

32
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:14,259
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- No, I don't go to malls!

33
00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:18,588
Sorry, I just don't like malls.

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,225
Why not?

35
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:22,654
I'd rather not say.

36
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:24,804
- Sharper Images.
- But that's where clothes live.

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,906
Guys, guys, guys,
Robin doesn't like malls.

38
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,303
If she doesn't want to tell us why,
she doesn't have to.

39
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:31,652
I think we should all
just respect her privacy.

40
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:33,085
Thanks, Ted.

41
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:35,333
So, what's the deal
with you and malls?

42
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,144
I thought you said that,
if I didn't want to talk about it,

43
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:38,291
I didn't have to.

44
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:40,032
Yeah, with those people.

45
00:01:40,047 --> 00:01:41,923
But I'm your boyfriend.
Come on. What is it?

46
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:43,033
Did you get arrested at a mall?

47
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:43,681
No.

48
00:01:43,698 --> 00:01:45,501
- Dumped at a mall?
- Ted.

49
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:47,610
Found out you were
Canadian at a mall?

50
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,592
Let it go.

51
00:01:48,604 --> 00:01:50,299
Trapped under a fake
boulder at a mall?

52
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:52,580
- Let it go.
- Mauled at the mall?

53
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:53,981
Let it go!

54
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:58,097
And who gets trapped under
a fake boulder at the mall?

55
00:01:59,073 --> 00:02:02,697
Not me in Ohio when I was nine,
that's for sure.

56
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:06,055
Sync by vNaru

57
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:21,823
I don't get it. Why won't Robin
tell me why she hates malls?

58
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:24,134
Ted, you should be happy
Robin has a secret.

59
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,504
The more you learn
about a person,

60
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:28,764
the better chance you have of
hitting the fatal "Oh" moment.

61
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:29,891
The "Oh" moment?

62
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:33,663
Yeah, that moment when you find
out that one detail about a person

63
00:02:33,678 --> 00:02:35,770
that is going to
be a deal breaker.

64
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:37,421
It's a promise ring.

65
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:40,948
I made a pact with God to stay
a virgin till I'm married.

66
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:45,180
I don't have an
eating disorder.

67
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:49,337
It's just when I put food in my mouth,
I chew it, and then I spit it out.

68
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,848
I just turned 30.

69
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:57,738
So trust me,
you want to postpone

70
00:02:57,752 --> 00:03:00,617
knowing anything about each
other for as long as possible.

71
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:03,625
Mmm. I disagree.
If there is some potential "Oh" moment,

72
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,444
I want to know about it right away.
I mean, what's the alternative?

73
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,934
I now pronounce you,
man and wife.

74
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:13,644
I love you.

75
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:15,813
I used to be a dude.

76
00:03:17,528 --> 00:03:19,153
Yeah, I agree with Ted.

77
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:22,112
In a real relationship,
you share everything.

78
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:24,612
That's why Marshall and
I don't keep any secrets.

79
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:27,011
You are such a cutie pie.
Here's a quarter.

80
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:28,891
Go play a song on the jukebox.

81
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:31,171
No, it's true.
They tell each other everything.

82
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:34,110
I can think of tons of things,
there's no way Marshall's told you.

83
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,327
Try me.

84
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:38,660
Do you know about the time
Marshall was in Trenton?

85
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:40,338
Donkey ate his pants. Yup.

86
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:41,949
Bill's bachelor
party in Memphis?

87
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:44,908
Oh, when they had to pump out
all the nickels from his stomach?

88
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:46,998
Wow. Okay. Seattle.

89
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:49,834
Trick question. Marshall's never
been to the Pacific Northwest

90
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:51,965
because he's afraid
of Sasquatch.

91
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,237
Damn, you're good.

92
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:56,783
I'm not afraid of Sasquatch,
I just think we should all be on alert.

93
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:00,524
Trust me. Not only do they
tell each other everything,

94
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,695
they want to know everything.

95
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,912
So after the shower I was brushing
my teeth. And I was like,

96
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:06,822
"Oh, man!
I wanted to have some orange juice.

97
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:08,163
I should have done that first."

98
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:09,832
But I already had the
toothpaste on the toothbrush.

99
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:12,340
So I just went ahead
and brushed them anyway.

100
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:14,499
What happened next?

101
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:19,310
Yeah, meanwhile,
Robin tells me nothing.

102
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:22,058
Fine. Do you want to know
what Robin's secret is?

103
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:23,151
You know?

104
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:24,618
Of course I know.

105
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,548
She couldn't look at us,
her face got flushed--

106
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:28,197
that's shame, my friend.

107
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:32,999
Our friend Robin used to do porn,
wait for it...

108
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:35,057
...ography.

109
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:37,728
Yeah, we didn't really
need to wait for that.

110
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:39,454
And it's ridiculous.

111
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,976
I don't know.
He could be right.

112
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:43,676
She does have the fake
orgasm noises down.

113
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:44,465
Hey!

114
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,075
What? The walls are thin.

115
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,763
That's not what I'm
"hey"ing you about.

116
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:50,774
You know what it might be?

117
00:04:50,787 --> 00:04:54,722
This is going to sound a little
crazy but what if Robin is married?

118
00:04:54,736 --> 00:04:57,372
Married? What does that
have to do with the mall?

119
00:04:57,387 --> 00:05:00,060
Well, maybe she got
married at the mall.

120
00:05:00,077 --> 00:05:01,763
Back home in Minnesota,
a ton of people get married

121
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:03,831
at the Mall of America.
It's great.

122
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:06,549
There's this gorgeous indoor
golf course for pictures,

123
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:09,060
numerous fine dining options,
and talk about a reasonable--

124
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:12,121
- We are not getting married at the mall!
- Well, just meet with the guy.

125
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:14,790
She's not married.
Robin hates marriage.

126
00:05:14,802 --> 00:05:17,220
Because she already
got married.

127
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:18,949
At the mall.

128
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:22,117
No, because before Robin
moved to New York, she...

129
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:24,088
What was she doing?

130
00:05:24,143 --> 00:05:26,267
Well, I don't know.
Whenever I ask her about Canada,

131
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:28,466
she kind of clams up.

132
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:30,327
She's a pretty private person.

133
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:33,205
Except when she's
talking about...

134
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:35,764
Oh, a friend of mine in Canada
got married way too young

135
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,293
and it really turned
her off to marriage.

136
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:39,992
What do you think of
this wedding cake?

137
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:41,505
Oh, I like it.

138
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:43,023
Hey, you remember that
friend of mine in Canada

139
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:44,662
who got married way too young?

140
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,002
Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Fields'
giant cookie.

141
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:50,582
No.

142
00:05:52,808 --> 00:05:55,490
My friend in Canada who
got married way too young,

143
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,872
they had to do their vows twice,
once in French.

144
00:05:57,884 --> 00:05:59,458
They speak French there, too?

145
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:01,457
God, that place is a mess.

146
00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:05,447
So you don't think there's
any "friend" from Canada?

147
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:06,764
Oh, I'm sure there is.

148
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:09,469
Just like I have a "friend" who
wet his bed till he was ten.

149
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:11,179
Use your brain, Ted.

150
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,987
Guys, there's no way
Robin is married.

151
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,735
It's ludicrous to
even suggest it.

152
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,996
- Thank you, Barney.
- 'Cause it's porn.

153
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,666
I need another beer.

154
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:24,965
Robin was not in porn.
I bet you anything that she's married.

155
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:26,563
$20,000 says it's porn.

156
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:27,903
I don't have $20,000.

157
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,805
Well, then what do you have?

158
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:32,375
- Well...
- No.

159
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,823
I've got it.
The ultimate wager--

160
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,114
slap bet.

161
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:39,351
Oh, slap bet.
We used to do those when I was a kid.

162
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:40,672
What the hell's a slap bet?

163
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:42,661
Whoever is right gets to slap
the other person in the face

164
00:06:42,697 --> 00:06:44,952
as hard as they possibly can--
but no rings.

165
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:47,641
Are you really going to do that?
That's so immature.

166
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:50,358
- You can be Slap Bet Commissioner.
- Ooh, I love it. What are my powers?

167
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:53,429
Um, if a problem arises and we
need a ruling, that's your job.

168
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:55,220
But you have to be unbiased

169
00:06:55,234 --> 00:06:58,477
and put the integrity of
slap bet above all else.

170
00:06:58,493 --> 00:07:01,219
This is an honor you will
take with you to your grave.

171
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:02,955
On your tombstone,
it will read,

172
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:06,298
"Lily Aldrin, caring wife,
loving friend,

173
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,287
Slap Bet Commissioner."

174
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,133
And your tombstone will read "Got
slapped by Marshall, so hard he died."

175
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,653
Okay. What if I just ask Robin
point blank if she has a husband?

176
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:20,765
You said you would
respect her privacy,

177
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,953
so maybe you should
just drop it.

178
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:24,831
Yeah, you're right.

179
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:28,172
Husband.

180
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:31,712
There's no "P" in husband.

181
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:34,709
Wow, you seem to know
a lot about husbands.

182
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,251
Fine. I'll take it back.

183
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:40,311
Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands,
this is great, you're going to love this.

184
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:42,937
Marshall, you know Marshall.
He thinks that the reason

185
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:44,477
you didn't want to go to
the mall the other day

186
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:48,609
is because you got married at a
mall and have a husband in Canada.

187
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:52,378
I told him he's crazy.
Because he's crazy, right?

188
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:54,816
I mean, how crazy is that?

189
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,145
Are you asking me
if I'm married?

190
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:58,427
Well, you can ask me.

191
00:07:58,441 --> 00:08:00,564
Nope, I'm not married.
Your turn.

192
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,684
What happened to
respecting my privacy?

193
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,353
Look, just say, "No,
I'm not married."

194
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:07,182
Ted, I don't understand
why you can't--

195
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:09,744
Just say, "No,
I'm not married."

196
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,392
I can't.

197
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:13,413
Marshall's right.

198
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:18,213
I was young and I got married.

199
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:20,190
It was a mistake and
he moved away, but...

200
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:23,029
yeah. I'm married.

201
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,214
You have a husband?

202
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:36,220
I was young and stupid

203
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:39,785
and we got married at a mall
and we broke up at a mall

204
00:08:39,803 --> 00:08:42,544
and I...
I haven't been to a mall since.

205
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,915
Why didn't you get divorced?

206
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:46,387
He moved to Hong Kong for
work and I was like...

207
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,803
eh, good enough.

208
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,026
Good enough?
That's not good enough.

209
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,132
You order pancakes, you get waffles,
that's good enough.

210
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,332
Look, I haven't
seen him in years.

211
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:59,192
It's just a part of my
life I want to forget.

212
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:02,490
Just please don't tell
anyone about this.

213
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:05,201
Okay.

214
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:10,750
Dude, your hand is monstrous.

215
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:13,471
Yeah, well, what'd you expect?
You've seen my penis.

216
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:17,738
I can't believe you
told us Robin's secret.

217
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:20,318
What? How could I keep
something like that to myself?

218
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,680
And you begged me to tell you.

219
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,137
No, I didn't.

220
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:26,187
Please tell us. Just tell us.
I'm begging you.

221
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:28,397
Tell us. Tell us. Tell us.
Please please please--

222
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,897
Fine. Robin's married.

223
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:34,986
Yeah, well,
you still shouldn't have told us.

224
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,906
I mean,
what kind of boyfriend are you?

225
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:38,926
See that's just it,
I'm not the boyfriend.

226
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:40,344
I'm the mistress.

227
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,796
No, not the mistress.

228
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,292
The mastress.

229
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:44,845
The master.
What do you call it?

230
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,955
Uh, pretty sure we're
going to call it mistress.

231
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,154
What am I going to do?
My girlfriend's married.

232
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:52,703
Do I ask her to get a divorce?

233
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:55,880
Ted, even if she is married,
it's a Canadian marriage.

234
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,950
It's like their money,
or their army.

235
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:00,009
Nobody takes it seriously.

236
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:01,212
It's serious to me.

237
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,119
You know what, in some countries,
if you been separated

238
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:05,871
for longer than five years,
technically, you're no longer married.

239
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:08,428
I can check it out at the
law library at school.

240
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:13,358
I can see my hand
print on your face.

241
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:16,088
Don't get too cocky, Slappy.

242
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:19,157
I just got a shipment of porn
from Canada I have to go through.

243
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:21,167
I won the bet.
Why are you still searching?

244
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:22,974
Just because you were right
doesn't mean I'm wrong.

245
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,337
Oh, right, like you need
an excuse to watch porn.

246
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:28,586
Canadian porn.

247
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:31,136
Trust me when I tell you their
universal health care system

248
00:10:31,148 --> 00:10:33,583
doesn't cover breast implants.

249
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,583
If I have to sit through one
more flat-chested Nova Scotian

250
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,874
riding a Mountie on
the back of a Zamboni

251
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:41,352
I'll go out of my mind.

252
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:46,140
- Hey.
- Hey.

253
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,342
Listen, dude,
I got to talk to you,

254
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:51,510
but you got to promise me
that you won't tell Barney.

255
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,028
Fine, I won't tell Barney.
What is it?

256
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:57,787
- Robin's not married.
- What?

257
00:10:57,802 --> 00:10:59,287
Why would she tell me she was?

258
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:01,448
I don't know, but I cross-
checked every record in Canada.

259
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:03,339
There's no record of
her ever being married.

260
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:04,477
There must be some mistake.

261
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:06,298
I promise you.
She's not married.

262
00:11:06,313 --> 00:11:08,657
She's not great at
parking legally either.

263
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:12,527
So she lied to me?
W--What am I going to do?

264
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:15,567
I-I can't confront her,
'cause then she'll know I told you.

265
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,856
You got to lawyer her.

266
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,416
You got to ask her a bunch of questions,
try to trip her up,

267
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:22,002
maybe make her feel guilty,
whatever it takes

268
00:11:22,038 --> 00:11:23,844
to get a confession out of her.

269
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:27,182
Thanks for telling
me your secret.

270
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:29,653
It means so much to me,
that you could be so--

271
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:31,500
God, what's the word
I'm looking for?

272
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:32,660
Honest.

273
00:11:32,677 --> 00:11:34,461
Mm, thanks, Ted.

274
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:36,609
Yeah. You know what's probably
the best part about your honesty?

275
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:38,480
How truthful it is.

276
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:40,599
I say we just move on.

277
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:43,748
Well, for me to get total
closure on this whole

278
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:46,060
"my girlfriend has
a husband" thing,

279
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:47,729
I think I might need a
little bit more information,

280
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:49,668
like what month did
you get married?

281
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:51,517
June. We had a June wedding.

282
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,876
Ah, Canada in June.

283
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:55,706
That's the dream.

284
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:58,548
Sit-down or buffet?

285
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:02,324
Well, it's...
weird that you don't remember.

286
00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:04,504
No, I just didn't
know how to answer

287
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,463
because we did butlered hors
d'oeuvres in the atrium,

288
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:10,504
but the actual dinner was
a buffet in the Food Court

289
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,902
featuring a filet mignon or a
roasted potato-crusted salmon

290
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,643
with a lobster
scallion beurre blanc.

291
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:21,122
Band or DJ?

292
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:23,301
A string quartet played
at the ceremony,

293
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:26,309
but for the actual reception,
we had a seven-piece band.

294
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:28,069
We paid extra for the sax

295
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:31,620
'cause I just love that
smooth alto sound.

296
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:33,310
- How many bridesmaids?
- Seven.

297
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:34,631
- Flowers?
- Azaleas.

298
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:36,928
- Color scheme?
- Dusty rose and sienna.

299
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:38,727
Husband's name.

300
00:12:41,184 --> 00:12:42,969
- You were never married!
- Yes, I was.

301
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:44,909
- No, you weren't.
- How do you know?

302
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:46,306
I looked it up at the library.

303
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:49,895
- What library?
- The one on Fifth.

304
00:12:49,911 --> 00:12:51,817
- When did you go?
- Today at lunch,

305
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:53,867
and I had an apple brie
panini with potato salad...

306
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,105
I'm not questioning
the lunch part, Ted.

307
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:57,715
What database did you use?

308
00:12:57,728 --> 00:13:02,452
I used the Canadian
Mall Marriage 6000.

309
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:05,333
Fine, Marshall looked
it up at school.

310
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,482
- You told Marshall?!
- You lied to me!

311
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,392
See, this is why I don't
tell people secrets.

312
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:11,950
You were supposed to be the
one person I trusted the most

313
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:13,632
and even you couldn't
keep a secret.

314
00:13:13,646 --> 00:13:14,963
But it was a fake secret.

315
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:17,239
Yeah, I was testing
you and you failed.

316
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,632
And now you're never gonna know
why I don't go to the mall.

317
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:21,649
And it's good, too.

318
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:23,549
You were testing me?
That's insane.

319
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:26,328
Oh, yeah? How long did it
take for you to tell Marshall

320
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:29,179
my biggest secret in the world?
Five minutes?

321
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:32,047
- That wasn't a real secret!
- Yeah, but it could have been.

322
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,409
You are driving me crazy!

323
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:35,325
No wonder your fake
husband moved to Hong Kong.

324
00:13:35,343 --> 00:13:37,595
He moved there for business.

325
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:40,335
You.

326
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:42,086
You got something to say to me?

327
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,906
What are you talking about?

328
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:46,944
I know Robin was
never really married.

329
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,874
How could you
possibly know that?

330
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:57,131
And then I put on my
pajamas and got into bed.

331
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:58,741
How about you?

332
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:02,092
Oh, let's see, uh,
first I took the subway to school.

333
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:03,391
Then I got a bagel.

334
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:05,762
Then I went to the library and
found out Robin was never married.

335
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:06,889
Crazy.

336
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:08,999
Then I was hungry again,
so I went down to the vending machine,

337
00:14:09,037 --> 00:14:12,170
but by the time I got down there,
I wasn't even hungry anymore.

338
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:15,549
- You told him?
- I had to.

339
00:14:15,565 --> 00:14:17,900
I'm Slap Bet Commissioner.

340
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:21,009
Believe me, this hurts me more
than it's gonna hurt you.

341
00:14:21,022 --> 00:14:23,937
Don't count on it.
I've been practicing on a tree trunk.

342
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:27,456
- Barney gets three slaps.
- Three?

343
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,517
One because you lied and two
for being prematurely slapped.

344
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:32,655
Three slaps.

345
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,756
But--

346
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,663
Oh, my God.

347
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,203
- Are you gonna cry?
- No.

348
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,214
You're gonna cry.

349
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:49,572
I just don't think it's healthy to
keep big secrets in a relationship.

350
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,493
My parents didn't really talk
to each other for 30 years

351
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:52,600
and now they're divorced.

352
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:54,413
I have shared more
of myself with you

353
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:56,521
than I've ever
shared with anyone.

354
00:14:56,536 --> 00:14:58,670
I'm asking for this one secret,

355
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:02,450
which has nothing to do with us,
to just be mine.

356
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:07,117
So I just got a very
interesting phone call.

357
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,547
What are you talking about?

358
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:10,337
I know Robin's secret.

359
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:11,969
- What?
- That's right.

360
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:13,737
I know your secret, Robin.

361
00:15:13,753 --> 00:15:17,548
Or should I say Robin Sparkles?

362
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,466
How do you know that name?

363
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,357
Because I know the truth,

364
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:23,944
and I am about to show
it to you right now.

365
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:25,654
Gather 'round, Ted,
you're gonna want to see this.

366
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:27,114
Yeah, no, I don't.

367
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:28,045
What?

368
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:30,574
Robin wants to keep
this a secret, so...

369
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,354
it's gonna stay a secret.

370
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,133
Yeah, it's not
gonna stay a secret.

371
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:36,512
You see, in my research,

372
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:38,902
I came upon a certain
gentleman in Malaysia

373
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,681
who is in possession of
a certain videotape.

374
00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:43,971
He just emailed me that
it will be up and running

375
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:47,491
on My Space in about...
right now.

376
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:52,169
Robin's world is about to
be turned upside-down.

377
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,691
I mean, I'm guessing.

378
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:54,840
Barney, don't, okay?

379
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:56,938
Robin, please don't panic.

380
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:58,970
I'm only gonna show enough to
prove to Marshall I was right.

381
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:01,227
No, Barney,
I said we're not watching this.

382
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:03,028
No, it's time.

383
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:04,886
Look, I appreciate what
you're trying to do,

384
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:08,307
but if it's out there, there's no
point in trying to hide it anymore.

385
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:11,097
Let's just watch it
and be done with it.

386
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:13,424
Are you as terrified as I am?

387
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:16,336
I don't want to
get slapped again.

388
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,262
I want to stress
that I was young.

389
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,474
Yeah, you were.

390
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,845
And I didn't know any better.

391
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,402
They never do.

392
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,063
And it started out as an
innocent modeling job.

393
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:30,092
It always does.

394
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,862
Please, Mr. Johnson.

395
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:35,240
I'm sorry I was a bad girl.

396
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:37,912
Please don't give me detention.

397
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:42,850
Isn't there something I can
do to make it up to you?

398
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:48,339
Oh, my God.

399
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,348
Well, obviously,
I've been proven right,

400
00:16:50,364 --> 00:16:52,406
so in the interest
of Robin's dignity,

401
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:53,679
I won't show anymore.

402
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:56,485
Plus, it's getting late.
It's already slap o'clock.

403
00:16:57,923 --> 00:16:59,484
What the hell was that?

404
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:02,226
Uh, I slap bet Marshall that
you did porn, so I win.

405
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,183
Porn? I wish it was porn.
It would be less embarrassing.

406
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:08,753
I know.

407
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:12,405
How about I sing you a song?

408
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:21,581
Let's go to the
mall, everybody!

409
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:30,850

- That's you?
- Yes.

416
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:47,306
I had one minor hit.

417
00:17:47,322 --> 00:17:51,325
I had to go all over Canada
and sing this song in malls.

418
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:55,495

00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:16,481
The '80s didn't come to Canada till,
like, '93.

425
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:21,331
Taking a break from the first of many,
many viewings,

426
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:23,897
I can't help but notice
that this isn't porn.

427
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:26,708
And yet,
a slap occurred without the permission

428
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:28,747
of the Slap Bet Commissioner.

429
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:32,438
Looks like somebody suffered
from premature slapulation.

430

435
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:44,396
Either ten slaps
right now in a row,

436
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:46,933
or five slaps that
can be doled out

437
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:50,493
at any point from
here to eternity.

438
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:51,924
You go with the ten now.

439
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:53,903
No way,
why get ten when you can get five?

440
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:55,932
Yeah, but the constant fear of
knowing that at any moment,

441
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,691
you could get slapped in the face,
would drive you crazy.

442
00:18:57,729 --> 00:18:59,342
I'm going to go with
the five for eternity.

443
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:01,963
- Good call.
- Horrible call.
