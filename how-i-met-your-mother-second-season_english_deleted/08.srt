1
00:00:00,585 --> 00:00:02,921
And so, after six months apart,

2
00:00:02,932 --> 00:00:05,653
Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall
were finally back together.

3
00:00:05,664 --> 00:00:07,088
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:09,593
These pancakes are delicious!

5
00:00:09,604 --> 00:00:10,905
Yes. Thank you.

6
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:12,945
Um, I learned how to cook while
you were gone this summer.

7
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:15,736
Oh. Do you want to
cook dinner tonight?

8
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:17,949
Yeah, sure.

9
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:20,076
How about pancakes?

10
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,331
And things were back
to normal... almost.

11
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:25,847
You may not have much range,
but at least I'm marrying a guy

12
00:00:25,854 --> 00:00:28,056
who knows how to make pancakes.

13
00:00:31,435 --> 00:00:33,049
Oh, um...

14
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,631
I mean, um...

15
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:39,159
Well, I... I realize that we
haven't really discussed

16
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:43,395
whether us getting back together
means us getting married, but...

17
00:00:43,849 --> 00:00:45,592
I still wanna.

18
00:00:45,606 --> 00:00:47,409
Do you still wanna?

19
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,169
Really?

20
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,154
Of course, I love you.

21
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:54,464
No, I mean,
that's how you're gonna do it?

22
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,598
"Do you still wanna?" That's
like the lamest proposal ever.

23
00:00:58,633 --> 00:01:02,705
When I did it, I got down on my knees...
I don't know, I'm just saying.

24
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:09,101
Marshall Eriksen,
will you ma...

25
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:11,276
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What?!

26
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,935
You can't lead with that.
You got to... build up to that.

27
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,632
You got to have,
like, a little speech.

28
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:19,479
Do you remember your
proposal to me?

29
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:22,486
I had a speech prepared.

30
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:24,495
What do you want to hear?

31
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,982
I don't know.
I mean, you could tell me,

32
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:31,766
like, about how good-looking
and funny and smart I am

33
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:33,295
and I've been
working out lately.

34
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:37,593
It might be nice for you to
mention something... about that.

35
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:40,122
Marshall...

36
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:43,017
- you are good-looking...
- Thank you.

37
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:44,465
- You're funny.
- Oh, thanks.

38
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:46,274
- You're smart.
- And a few tears wouldn't hurt.

39
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,104
Okay, would you freakin'
marry me already?

40
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,321
I'll marry you. Of course.

41
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:54,788
But, um, until you see a ring on this
finger, don't expect me to put out.

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,743
Yeah, right.

43
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,819
Sync by vNaru

44
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:18,943
I'll give you this.

45
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:21,910
That was a very
creative use of syrup.

46
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:26,395
I can't even look Mrs.
Butterworth in the eye.

47
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,930
Oh, my God.
We're getting married!

48
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:33,661
I know, I know.

49
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,188
It was a moment of happiness,

50
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:39,065
followed of course by a
moment of total panic.

51
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:41,181
See, when they called
off their first wedding,

52
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:43,492
Aunt Lily took off
for San Francisco

53
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:45,860
leaving Uncle Marshall
with the unfortunate task

54
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,628
of telling his entire family.

55
00:02:47,643 --> 00:02:50,602
Yeah, so now she's gone
and the wedding's off.

56
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:52,993
What do you call someone who just
takes off and leaves like that?

57
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:54,481
What do you call that?

58
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:58,188
I think that that's
a little strong.

59
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:01,335
I can't even believe you
would use a word like that.

60
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,250
Geez, Grandma.

61
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:08,655
Man, I made a big mess by
canceling this wedding, didn't I?

62
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,615
It's okay, baby.

63
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,871
You're not just realizing that now,
are you?

64
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:18,996
God, the idea of standing up
there in front of all those people

65
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:20,896
who hate my guts...

66
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,162
just makes me want to run off to
Atlantic City and get married today.

67
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:26,680
Yeah.

68
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:33,125
Coming up at 11:00:
Are there piranhas in the East River?

69
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:36,969
What you don't know...
could eat you.

70
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:39,227
Robin! Stop the news!

71
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:41,355
- What the hell?
- It's okay. They're my friends.

72
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:44,214
We're going to Atlantic City to elope.
You got to come with us.

73
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,201
Oh, my God,
that is so fantastic!

74
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:48,099
I-I don't know if I
can just leave work.

75
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:50,729
It's okay;
Mike can read the news tonight.

76
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:53,825
Hey, Mike...
you can read, right?

77
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,231
Yeah, I'm the best at reading.

78
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:59,389
- Let's go to Atlantic City!
- Yeah!

79
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:04,554
You guys are eloping!
Oh, that's fantastic.

80
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,322
Wait, is this because there's a time
crunch Uncle Ted should know about?

81
00:04:07,358 --> 00:04:10,227
I hope not because I plan
on getting hammered.

82
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:13,546
Guys, this sounds like so much fun,
but I can't really take off work.

83
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:16,273
I'm kind of important around here,
you know? I'm the project manager.

84
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:18,282
Ted, for the rest of our lives,

85
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:20,470
we are going to be
telling the amazing story

86
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:23,145
of how we went to Atlantic
City and got married.

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,666
Don't you want to
be in that story?

88
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:27,153
Of course I do.

89
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:28,962
- Let's go to Atlantic City!
- Yeah!

90
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:32,247
Oh, but when we tell the story, can you
leave out the part where I hesitate?

91
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:33,735
You got it.

92
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,564
Hey, guys.

93
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:40,292
Wow. A pedicure.

94
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:43,119
Uh, if there were any shame
in a dude getting a pedicure

95
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:47,294
I don't think there would have been a
feature about it in Details magazine.

96
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,042
We're going to Atlantic
City to elope right now!

97
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,450
Oh, congratulations, Lily.

98
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:56,407
Marshall, you're getting married?
What the hell?

99
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,374
So are you in or not?

100
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,824
Hell, yeah, I'm in!

101
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:01,351
Just... I'm almost done.

102
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,169
- No, we got to get going to the...
- Well, actually, I mean...

103
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:07,316
It is my wedding day,
and since we're here...

104
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,882
So we all got a pedicure
and then headed down...

105
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:14,187
to Atlantic City.

106
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:23,911
Wow. Look at this place.

107
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,176
I guess I'll have my
pick of something old.

108
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:29,554
And something blue. Somebody
should really check on this lady.

109
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:33,871
Ah, A.C., always in decline,

110
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:35,549
never hitting bottom.

111
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:37,806
It's good to be back,
old friend.

112
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:39,257
You been here before?

113
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:40,912
Oh, uh, once or twice.

114
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:42,253
Barney!

115
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:45,099
Ah, good to see you, too.

116
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,286
Three times, maybe.

117
00:05:47,953 --> 00:05:50,135
The wedding chapel--
this is it.

118
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:51,954
Are you ready to do this?

119
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:53,351
I'm ready.

120
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:55,588
- Let's get married.
- Yeah.

121
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:58,028
Oh, crap. I don't have a veil.

122
00:05:58,043 --> 00:06:00,964
I'm a bride;
I can't get married without a veil.

123
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,870
And a bouquet.
I need a veil and a bouquet.

124
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:06,409
Oh, my God,
we're getting married.

125
00:06:06,423 --> 00:06:08,697
Don't worry. Relax.
We'll get you a veil, honey.

126
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:11,056
Oh, Robin,
that's a really cute outfit.

127
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:12,302
Oh, really? Thanks.

128
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,140
Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride;
you can't look better than me.

129
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:16,391
Done.

130
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,377
I'm going to get the bouquet.
You guys get the veil.

131
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,446
We'll meet in the
chapel in 20 minutes.

132
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:23,024
Ready, break.

133
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:26,889
You guys want to go gamble?

134
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:28,339
No, we got to go get the veil.

135
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:30,585
Or we looked everywhere,
and we couldn't find one.

136
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,966
Yeah, okay.

137
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,994
No, you guys go ahead.
I'm going to find the veil.

138
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:40,418
So this is it, right?
The last 20 minutes of your single life.

139
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:41,535
- I'm proud of you, buddy.
- Thanks.

140
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:43,236
- How are you feeling?
- Great, a little nervous.

141
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,072
- Yeah? Craps?
- Not that nervous.

142
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:47,559
- No, I mean do you want to play craps.
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

143
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:49,207
Okay, I got the veil.

144
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:50,656
She wasn't ready to be married.

145
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:52,232
All right,
let's talk bachelor party.

146
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,385
Are we thinking full-on strip club,
or should we rent a room

147
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,161
and have a private
toy show-- whew.

148
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:58,611
What did you just say?

149
00:06:58,624 --> 00:07:01,609
- Barney, no.
- Marshall, I'm your best man.

150
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:03,297
- You're not my best man.
- Right here.

151
00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:06,182
And as your best man,
I have to throw you a bachelor party.

152
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,780
That's part of
being a best friend.

153
00:07:07,798 --> 00:07:08,851
- You're not my best friend.
- Right here.

154
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,157
Barney, I don't have any
time for a bachelor party.

155
00:07:11,184 --> 00:07:13,445
I've got, like, 18 minutes.

156
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:16,113
18 minutes.

157
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,091
Oh, good. Did you get the veil?

158
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,220
Of course.

159
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,357
And it took us
exactly 18 minutes.

160
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:25,504
We went to a strip club.

161
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,035
- Dude!
- Unbelievable!

162
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,741
We weren't there for very long.
It's not like I had time

163
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:31,799
to have a lap dance or anything.
I got a lap dance.

164
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:34,268
- Your last lap dance ever.
- Right...

165
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,247
What?

166
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,342
Okay, I'm here. Right?

167
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:42,408
Oh, God, the things people
waste money on in Atlantic City.

168
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:44,148
Does it smell like
strippers in here?

169
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:45,517
That's weird, right?

170
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,754
Marshall and Lily
are getting married!

171
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,871
Hell, yeah, look at this.

172
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:55,416
Oh, baby, this is it.

173
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,633
- Let's do this thing.
- All right.

174
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,694
Hi. We're here to get married.

175
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,889
Congratulations. We offer
a variety of packages

176
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:07,397
to give you the special day
you've always dreamed about.

177
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:10,463
We don't want any of that. Just your
basic quickie wedding will be fine.

178
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,751
Yeah.

179
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:16,845
You know this
isn't Vegas, right?

180
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:19,676
Well, sure.
In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen.

181
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,973
Here, it looks like
everyone brought their own.

182
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:24,139
What?

183
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:28,755
It also takes three days to get
a marriage license in New Jersey.

184
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,815
The earliest I could
book you for is Monday.

185
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,269
No, no, no, it has to be today.
That's the whole point.

186
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:35,738
Look, I don't know what to say,

187
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:38,355
but if you guys don't want
to book a wedding for Monday

188
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:41,244
or play a round of keno,
I can't help you.

189
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:44,083
Thirty-five.

190
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:54,512
Wait, I don't understand, people get
married in Atlantic City all the time.

191
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:56,698
Yes, they do,
but they don't elope.

192
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:59,646
They choose Atlantic City
for its white sand beaches,

193
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:03,012
world-class amenities,
and exotic Riviera feel.

194
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:04,591
Have you been outside?

195
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:08,149
There is half an orca whale rotting
not 20 feet from the cabana.

196
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:09,636
You guys, take it easy, guys.

197
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:11,026
Are you sure about this?

198
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:14,892
About the marriage laws of the state
where I work in a wedding chapel?

199
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:16,741
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

200
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:20,256
Bright side:
the bachelor party continues!

201
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:21,117
Yes!

202
00:09:21,132 --> 00:09:23,774
Continues? You mean
"start." He means "start."

203
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,621
We went to a strip club.

204
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:28,220
Twenty-seven.

205
00:09:29,884 --> 00:09:32,795
Is there any way that we
could get a license today?

206
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:34,385
You could go to the courthouse.

207
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,169
In some extreme circumstances,
the waiting period can be waived,

208
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:40,049
but you have to
have a good reason.

209
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,418
Well, we're in love.

210
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:43,315
What better reason
could there be?

211
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,405
The last one I heard was,

212
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:47,262
"I'm going to Iraq tomorrow
to defend my country,"

213
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:50,329
but, you know,
give yours a whirl.

214
00:09:51,602 --> 00:09:54,074
So we went to the courthouse.

215
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:57,411
God, this is taking forever.

216
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,991
Can't believe they're
getting married.

217
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:00,898
I know.

218
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:03,807
I am so proud of these two.
After all they've been through.

219
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:06,745
In fact,
that crazy road has led them

220
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:09,190
all the way here
to Atlantic City.

221
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:10,788
Ted, up here.

222
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:14,176
You were just staring
at my shirt boobs.

223
00:10:14,193 --> 00:10:15,675
No! I wasn't.

224
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,942
I-I was checking out the hot
bod underneath the shirt.

225
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,217
Okay, look,
maybe I was looking at your shirt,

226
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:26,317
but it's a, it's a funny,
funny shirt.

227
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:28,453
Hey, it's Barney!

228
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,331
- Barney!
- Hi.

229
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:35,448
...suit up.

230
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:45,217
...legend.

231
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,163
...Daddy.

232
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:49,852
American daddy.

233
00:10:55,534 --> 00:10:56,958
What the hell was that?

234
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:59,515
A... Chinese guy?

235
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:03,379
Hi. Hello.
Uh, we need a marriage license,

236
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:06,369
but we need to skip the
waiting period because...

237
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:07,516
we're in love.

238
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:11,384
Aw. I'm gonna waive this
waiting period right now.

239
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:12,452
Oh, really?!

240
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,758
Is what I would say if I could
waive the waiting period,

241
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,835
but unfortunately,
only a judge can do that.

242
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:20,526
Oh. Well,
so can we see a judge?

243
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:22,451
- Absolutely.
- Really?!

244
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:25,479
Is what I would say if there was any
chance of you seeing a judge today,

245
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:27,817
which there isn't.

246
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,973
Why are you doing this to us?!

247
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,403
'Cause you're on Candid Camera!

248
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,290
- Really?!
- Is what I would say...

249
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:37,108
You know what? We get it.

250
00:11:39,411 --> 00:11:42,525
Okay, this is a good plan B.

251
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:44,713
Judges are people.
People go to the batoom.

252
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:46,769
A judge is bound to
come by eventually,

253
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:48,128
and we'll get married.

254
00:11:48,144 --> 00:11:50,365
I'm sure we won't
be waiting long.

255
00:11:56,686 --> 00:12:00,215
Geez, you go to a vending
machine for 30 seconds.

256
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,537
Vultures.

257
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:10,087
What?

258
00:12:11,691 --> 00:12:12,783
Here?

259
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,222
Yeah. Got a little
time to kill.

260
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,078
Oh, my God,
it's the T-shirt, isn't it?

261
00:12:19,092 --> 00:12:20,158
No.

262
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:21,468
A little.

263
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:24,025
Something is seriously
wrong with you.

264
00:12:24,051 --> 00:12:26,093
So what, is that a no?

265
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:28,929
- All right, let's do it.
- All right.

266
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:30,748
Um, also...?

267
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:32,646
- Yes, I'll leave it on.
- Sweet.

268
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,565
Guys, let's bail.
This is never gonna happen.

269
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,639
Look, I know this is turning
into a bit of a disaster,

270
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,858
but believe me,
it's better than the alternative.

271
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:44,915
You throwing a big,
free party with lots of booze and food

272
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,482
and all your single,
desperate girlfriends from college?

273
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:50,410
Yeah, glad we
dodged that bullet.

274
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:53,865
Judge! Judge, come on.
Come on, come on, come on!

275
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,178
- Turn it off.
- Okay.

276
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,602
May we please get
married today?

277
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:10,659
Now, normally I would say
no to a request like that,

278
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:12,769
but you two impress me.

279
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:15,905
Just the fact that you've
been together for ten years,

280
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:19,482
standing by each other's
side through thick and thin,

281
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,789
never wavering.

282
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:25,218
- What was that?
- What was what?

283
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:27,203
That little look.
What was that?

284
00:13:27,878 --> 00:13:29,953
A look of love.

285
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:34,068
You two have stood together
through thick and thin, right?

286
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:36,755
- You know, what's thick, what's thin?
- Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.

287
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,943
I have.

288
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:40,402
All right, what was that look?

289
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,780
What's going on?

290
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:44,549
They broke up over the summer.

291
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:48,205
Lily totally ran off to San Francisco
and these two just had sex in the closet.

292
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:51,461
What? We're under oath.

293
00:13:51,478 --> 00:13:52,849
No, we're not.

294
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:56,499
Yeah, we are. He's a judge.

295
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:58,115
Wh-- did we take an oath?

296
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:00,073
Do you even know
what an oath is?

297
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,161
Uh, yeah. Courthouse.

298
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:05,347
Oath. We're under it.

299
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,060
Guys. It's looking like
this isn't gonna happen.

300
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:15,619
No, Marshall,
we are gonna get married today.

301
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:18,787
Baby, anyplace we go,
we're gonna need a marriage license.

302
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:21,412
Except international waters.

303
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,781
So-so let's find
a ship captain.

304
00:14:23,798 --> 00:14:25,558
A ship captain can marry us.

305
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:27,689
There's boats all
over this place.

306
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,577
Oh, is that what those wooden things
are floating between the garbage?

307
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:34,751
This is a great idea.
This is gonna work. Let's go.

308
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:38,378
Excuse me.
Are you a ship captain?

309
00:14:38,392 --> 00:14:40,505
This is my machine.

310
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:44,930
- I should go talk to her.
- No, let me.

311
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:49,286
- Blackjack?
- Yeah.

312
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:55,773
Well, I found a guy who said he'd be
willing to put his boat in my slip,

313
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:57,618
so we're getting closer.

314
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:01,694
Okay, Lil, why is it
so important to do this today?

315
00:15:01,711 --> 00:15:04,844
Because... if we
don't do it today,

316
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:07,581
I just know we're gonna wind
up having a huge wedding

317
00:15:07,596 --> 00:15:11,148
with a huge crowd full of
huge Midwestern people

318
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,296
looking all disapproving
and judging me

319
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,264
while sipping little
cups of mayonnaise

320
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,200
and-and cracking runaway
bride jokes all night long.

321
00:15:18,214 --> 00:15:19,898
- Nobody's gonna do that.
- No, they're not

322
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:21,599
because I'm not gonna
give them the chance.

323
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:24,635
I'm gonna find a ship captain and
we're gonna be married tonight.

324
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,321
Sweetie, this is crazy.

325
00:15:26,338 --> 00:15:27,631
You're never gonna
find a ship capt...

326
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:29,859
Hey, Lily.
Found a ship captain.

327
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:31,369
- What?
- Yeah.

328
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:33,776
First guy we talked to.
Ship captain.

329
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,243
How great is that?

330
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:38,121
See? See, this is destiny.

331
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:41,917
So, captain, can you take us out to
international waters and marry us?

332
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:42,957
I sure can.

333
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:46,645
If there's two things I love, it's
bringing people together in marriage

334
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:48,891
- and making $5,000.
- What?

335
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:52,259
Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that.
Come on, everybody.

336
00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:55,164
Fork over your cash.
Don't think. Just do it.

337
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:56,636
I can get us that money.

338
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,753
How?

339
00:15:57,768 --> 00:15:59,462
Have you noticed
that all day today

340
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:02,377
Chinese guys have been coming
up and saying hi to me?

341
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,687
Yes. Have you noticed I
haven't asked about it

342
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:06,694
because I'm too
scared of the answer?

343
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:09,124
Well, those are my
old gambling buddies.

344
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:11,710
Truth is...
I used to come here all the time.

345
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:15,558
Play an old Chinese game
called "Shing Hasabu Shing".

346
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:17,654
Had a small gambling problem.

347
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,682
Actually, it wasn't
so small. I...

348
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:22,831
kind of lost my entire
life's savings.

349
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:25,479
But tonight, I don't know,
I'm feeling hot.

350
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,874
I think I can win
us that money.

351
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,824
No, we're not letting you
gamble all our money away.

352
00:16:30,846 --> 00:16:34,880
Uh, it's not gambling if you
absolutely know you're going to win.

353
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:36,928
I'll get us that money.

354
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:39,955
I swear it, nay...

355
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:42,170
I oath it.

356
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:45,647
Now, I had been to a lot of
casinos before that night,

357
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:48,076
and I've been to a
lot of casinos since,

358
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,782
but in all that time I've never
seen a game quite like this one.

359
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:54,391
To this day,
I have no idea how it was played.

360
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:56,469
But luckily, Barney did.

361
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,404
Do you understand
what's happening?

362
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:01,185
Not a clue.

363
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,675
Do you think he's winning?

364
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,691
I don't even know
if he's playing.

365
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:33,154
Wait, I get it.
I understand this game.

366
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:33,894
No, you don't.

367
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:36,209
I totally understand
the game, Theodore.

368
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:39,626
Barney, split your tiles. You can triple
your money if you find the jellybean.

369
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,816
Marshall, please.
Don't you think I know what I'm...

370
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,241
My God, you're right.

371
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:27,982
Wow. It's beautiful.

372
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,400
Thanks, Barney.

373
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,050
Did you guys see me?
I was on fire tonight.

374
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:32,487
Man, I can't wait to
get back to the shore.

375
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:34,286
God, I love gambling!

376
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:37,222
When we get home, we're gonna
go to a little meeting. Okay?

377
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:39,331
Why can't I do it
just a little?

378
00:18:41,514 --> 00:18:42,747
Okay.

379
00:18:43,342 --> 00:18:45,584
Let's get this started.

380
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:49,021
Okay, uh...

381
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,749
you guys want the serious
one or the funny one?

382
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,978
Oh, I think...
serious would be best.

383
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,793
You sure? I got a lot of
great nautical jokes in there.

384
00:18:58,817 --> 00:19:01,999
Like how you two float each
other's boat, stuff like that.

385
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,077
Yeah, serious is probably good.

386
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:11,170
"We stand witness today

387
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:15,817
"to celebrate the union
of Lily and Marshall.

388
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:18,524
"Today, you two
will become one,

389
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,582
"sharing your lives,

390
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:22,831
"the happiness, the sadness,

391
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:25,139
"the frustrations
and the joy..."

392
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:26,997
This is pretty cool.

393
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:29,425
I can't believe you never
want to get married.

394
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,611
I never said "never."

395
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,619
"...to declare your love

396
00:19:33,635 --> 00:19:35,347
"and devotion to each other

397
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,655
"in front of
friends and family,

398
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:41,741
"all the people who
matter most to you."

399
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,460
What was that?

400
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:45,299
What was what?

401
00:19:46,173 --> 00:19:49,137
That little look.
You two just shared a look.

402
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,930
- We don't want to do this.
- We don't.

403
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,019
Are you kidding me?

404
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,395
You guys are calling
off another wedding?

405
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:04,030
After I spent all this
money on a bridesmaid shirt?

406
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:07,228
Did I bet someone that they'd call it
off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?

407
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:10,497
You actually expect any of us are
gonna come to your third wedding?

408
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:11,785
Yes.

409
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:14,300
'Cause it's gonna be amazing.

410
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:18,149
Look, before I was afraid
to face Marshall's family

411
00:20:18,163 --> 00:20:21,115
and-and I didn't want to
do all that work, but...

412
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,073
now that we're here...

413
00:20:23,117 --> 00:20:26,271
I realize that I have to
face Marshall's family

414
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:29,588
and I really want to
do all that work.

415
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:30,968
So do I.

416
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,883
And yeah... my family
might still be upset with you.

417
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:37,502
But when they see us up there, they're
gonna see how much we love each other

418
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:40,309
and none of that other
stuff is gonna matter.

419
00:20:40,443 --> 00:20:43,345
- I love you, Marshall.
- I love you, too, Lily pad.

420
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,411
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

421
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:46,691
- What?!
- What?!

422
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:48,369
What, is that not right?

423
00:20:48,383 --> 00:20:50,899
Are... we married?
Did you just marry us?

424
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:52,976
Weren't you listening?
We don't want to be married.

425
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:56,692
Uh... I-I suppose I
could unpronounce you.

426
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:59,501
- Unpronounce us.
- Unpronounce us!

427
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,887
All right,
I unpronounce you man and wife.

428
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:04,254
Oh, whew... that was close.

429
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:07,204
And that's the story of how
Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily

430
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:09,332
got married for 12 seconds

431
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:11,678
somewhere off the
coast of Atlantic City.

432
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,952
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

433
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,102
Ted.

434
00:21:28,715 --> 00:21:30,232
Is Robin here?

435
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:31,948
Man, I hope so.
