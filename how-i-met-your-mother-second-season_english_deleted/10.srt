1
00:00:00,743 --> 00:00:02,609
Kids, there's nothing
more wonderful

2
00:00:02,619 --> 00:00:04,395
than New York City
in the winter...

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,587
except the view of New
York City in the winter

4
00:00:06,597 --> 00:00:08,461
through your apartment window.

5
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:11,392
In the winter of 2006,
Marshall, Lily, Robin and I

6
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:13,989
were all deep in couple
hibernation mode.

7
00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:16,695
Sadly, this left Uncle
Barney out in the cold.

8
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:18,885
Okay. All-night rave,

9
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:20,750
abandoned tire
factory in Newark.

10
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:22,517
We're on the list. Who's in?

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,248
- Nope.
- No.

12
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:30,206
Private jet. Teeterboro Airport,
skinny-skydiving. Who's in?

13
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:31,685
- Nope.
- No, thanks.

14
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,535
One beer. Bar, downstairs,
15 second walk. Who's in?

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,029
Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye.

16
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:47,018
It got so bad,
Barney tried to be his own wingman.

17
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:49,408
Hi. Have you met me?

18
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:54,062
Finally, he decided to
bring in reinforcements.

19
00:00:54,077 --> 00:00:55,506
- No.
- No.

20
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:58,270
Yes. And do you know why?

21
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:01,844
Hang on to your bedsores,
grandparents from Willy Wonka,

22
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:05,076
because guess who's on his way
up to this apartment right now?

23
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:07,910
My... wait for it...

24
00:01:07,925 --> 00:01:10,534
brother, James. React.

25
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:11,714
- Hey!
- Hey!

26
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,206
- You have a brother?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:17,428
He's the "awesome-est," most best
"looking-est," greatest guy ever.

28
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:19,382
He's exactly like Barney.

29
00:01:19,398 --> 00:01:20,922
That's what I just said.

30
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:24,318
Well, Barney and his brother
aren't exactly alike.

31
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,821
James is gay.

32
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,751
Really? I never in
a million years

33
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:30,405
would I picture you with a gay brother,
that's awesome.

34
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:32,145
Yeah. I just wanted
you to have a heads up,

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,607
so you don't act all
surprised when he gets here.

36
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:36,310
Here he is.

37
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:40,257
What up, New York.

38
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:44,381
Thanks for the heads up.

39
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:47,418
Sync by vNaru

40
00:01:58,442 --> 00:02:02,811
How in God's name did it never come up
that Barney has a gay, black brother?

41
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:04,413
Is he black?

42
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:07,225
I guess I'm the kind of person that
focuses on who people are on the inside

43
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,587
rather than the
color of their skin.

44
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:12,582
I'm kidding,
I just wanted to see your face.

45
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,885
Yeah, so now the
wedding's back on.

46
00:02:14,898 --> 00:02:16,624
Anyway, James,
how have you been?

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,137
Awesome, as per "yoozh."

48
00:02:18,154 --> 00:02:21,121
I just went
skinny-skydiving. Legendary.

49
00:02:21,135 --> 00:02:23,933
And my laser tag team,
just made it to regional finals.

50
00:02:23,948 --> 00:02:25,694
"Legendarier."

51
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,698
And by now you've
noticed the suit--

52
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,758
go 'head, touch it.

53
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,440
Handcrafted by
Pietro Dellacamera,

54
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:35,266
Milan's famous
101-year-old tailor

55
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,567
who upon completing
the very last stitch

56
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,591
in this suit dropped dead,

57
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:42,626
which is ironic because that
is how gorgeous I look in it.

58
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:43,866
C'mon.

59
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:49,993
Gimme five.

60
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:51,615
Is "gimme five" back?

61
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,016
Oh, yeah.
I put it in my blog this morning.

62
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:56,569
Guys, "gimme five" is back!

63
00:02:56,837 --> 00:02:58,693
Oh, James,
this is my girlfriend, Robin.

64
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,106
- Hey. It's so nice to meet you.
- You, too.

65
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:03,906
So, I have to ask,
there's a story here.

66
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,700
Please.

67
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:08,745
The truth is,
Barney and James got a lot of...

68
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,144
different explanations from
their mom over the years.

69
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:13,319
Well, boys, you look different

70
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:15,362
because when I was
pregnant with you,

71
00:03:15,376 --> 00:03:17,592
I only ate vanilla ice cream.

72
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:19,577
And when I was
pregnant with you,

73
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:21,716
can you guess what kind
of ice cream I ate?

74
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:23,800
- Coffee?
- No, James,

75
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:26,131
I ate chocolate ice cream.

76
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:29,938
But I did drink tons of coffee when
I was pregnant with both of you.

77
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:32,090
Can't smoke without my coffee.

78
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,896
I don't know, boys,
I guess it's just one of those things.

79
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:39,288
Stop asking me!

80
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,179
You know what you two are?
You're little racists!

81
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:44,133
So what are you guys
gonna do tonight?

82
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:45,695
I'll tell you what
James is gonna do.

83
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:47,716
He's gonna do the job
you've been neglecting.

84
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,619
And, as always, he'll do it a
lot better than you ever did.

85
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:52,911
Ted...

86
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:56,035
James is my wingman now.

87
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:57,969
Okay.

88
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:02,242
Last time James was in town,
Barney got slapped once,

89
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:03,924
lucky twice, and...

90
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:05,775
whose penthouse hot
tub did you end up in?

91
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,158
Ah, public figure,
confidentiality agreement.

92
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:09,479
But I will say this:

93
00:04:09,494 --> 00:04:11,121
way more back hair than any guy

94
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:14,286
who can afford laser hair
removal should have.

95
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:18,430
And then there was the time they
scored the brother/sister combo.

96
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:20,031
It was everything
we ever dreamed of

97
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:21,865
when watching Donnie and Marie.

98
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,766
She was a little bit country.

99
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:26,551
He was a little bit
way into black guys.

100
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:30,023
Yeah, Barney and James together
was a lethal combination.

101
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,437
Since there was never
any crossover in targets,

102
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:35,558
James was always there for
Barney with the assist.

103
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:42,086
Whoa. Your scarf...

104
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:44,009
it is fierce!

105
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,602
Thanks. H & M.

106
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:47,123
What? I would never know,

107
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,498
'cause it is so hot that my eyes
are melting. Oh, I can't see.

108
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:54,080
Hey! You know,
speaking of things

109
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:55,881
that would look good
wrapped around you,

110
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,316
have you met my straight
brother, Barney?

111
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:02,801
Oh, he is fab--
don't you go nowhere-- "ulous." Okay?

112
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,292
And Barney always
returned the favor.

113
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:06,853
Help, I don't think
he's breathing.

114
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,586
Does anyone
know mouth-to-mouth?

115
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:10,590
Oh, my God, I do!

116
00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:13,453
Okay, great.
How 'bout you instead?

117
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,505
Oh, man,
I am so excited that you're here!

118
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:18,639
It has been forever since
I have been around anyone

119
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,299
even remotely fun.

120
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:22,252
Uh, yes offense.

121
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,994
You guys are still going
out with us tonight, right?

122
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,605
- No.
- Jammies.

123
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:28,980
Tonight? It's after 9:00 and...

124
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:31,011
I have warm soup belly.

125
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:34,016
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys...

126
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,808
you are young,
attractive people here

127
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:39,299
in the greatest city on earth.

128
00:05:39,316 --> 00:05:40,772
There are boys and girls

129
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:43,544
in Nobody Cares, Wyoming,
wishing they could be here.

130
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:46,838
But instead, they are in someone's
basement drinking bad malt liquor,

131
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:49,553
debating whether or not they're
going to spend their Saturday night

132
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:51,082
in the parking lot
of the feed store

133
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:53,385
or in some other
dude's basement.

134
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:55,857
You owe it to them to rise up

135
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:58,238
and shimmy your lazy
asses into something hot,

136
00:05:58,253 --> 00:06:01,420
and you go out there and
you live their dream!

137
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:03,191
- Can I get a "hell, yeah"?
- Hell, yeah!

138
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:05,773
- Can I get a "hell, yeah"?
- Hell, yeah!

139
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,447
- Can I get a "woo-woo"?
- Woo-woo!

140
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:10,602
Go do it for Wyoming! Yes!

141
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:12,383
Testify!

142
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:15,576
So that night,
Barney got his wish.

143
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:16,726
We all went out.

144
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,237
Daddy's home!

145
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:19,858
Yeah.

146
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:24,214
All right, bro.
What do you like?

147
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:26,403
Guy in super tight black T?

148
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:28,091
Super tight black guy?

149
00:06:28,106 --> 00:06:29,683
Guy who looks like Mr. T?

150
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:33,045
Mmm, yes, yes, and...
talk to me after two martinis.

151
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:35,108
Let's focus on you, my man.

152
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:37,198
I'm feeling lazy.

153
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:38,921
How 'bout girl with
the chocolatini?

154
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:41,866
Oh... boom, back tattoo.

155
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,588
Hero and the pig?

156
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,509
- Let's ride.
- Fo' 'sho.

157
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:50,715
Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!

158
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:52,385
- Get off me, you pig!
- Hey! Hey!

159
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:54,579
Her body art is not an
invitation to grope her,

160
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:56,681
it's an expression
of her inner self.

161
00:06:56,696 --> 00:07:00,725
I'm sure, in many ways,
she is the dolphin encircled by flowers.

162
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,256
- What? What?
- What? What?

163
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:04,001
Cool.

164
00:07:06,337 --> 00:07:07,915
Let me know if he
bothers you again.

165
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,456
Thanks. You should stay close...
just in case.

166
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:14,360
Sure. If it'll make
you feel safer.

167
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:15,874
I'm Barney.

168
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:19,345
Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy,
crowded bar,

169
00:07:19,362 --> 00:07:22,229
you can always tell the
difference between the singles

170
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:23,813
and the couples.

171
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:26,192
You just have to
look for the signs.

172
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:28,008
- Break.
- Boiling hot.

173
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:30,277
Singles stay on their
feet for maneuverability.

174
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:31,740
- Hey!
- Hi, how are ya?

175
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:34,494
Have you met my brother?

176
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,437
Oh, hello. Have a drink.

177
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,129
Nice to meet ya.

178
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:44,624
Couples, exhausted by the
sheer act of leaving the house,

179
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,048
are obsessed with finding
a place to sit down.

180
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,242
There are a lot of
other indicators, too.

181
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:52,424
From choice of
social lubricant...

182
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:56,246
...to basic body language.

183
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:58,982
But the point is,
there are many ways to tell

184
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:01,111
whether someone
has Single Stamina

185
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,556
or Couples Coma.

186
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:04,147
I wish I would've
worn sneakers.

187
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:07,001
I just got finished running
from some fat, hairy guy

188
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:09,471
who was periscoping out
of his pleather pants.

189
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:12,015
Permission to come
aboard denied.

190
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:13,988
I miss my jammies.

191
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:16,299
I can't believe I
wore a bra for this.

192
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:19,304
Bras suck.
They're so confining and unnatural.

193
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:21,507
Yeah, they're like
a boobie zoo.

194
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:24,069
Well, why don't you take it off
then and let those puppies breathe?

195
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:26,211
Oh, please go sweat
on someone else.

196
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:28,402
Poor guy.

197
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,754
Poor guy? Poor my boobs.

198
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,667
Well, it takes a lot of
guts to approach a girl

199
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:34,180
and you just crushed him.

200
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:37,543
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He looks all broken up inside.

201
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:39,356
Whatever, you guys have
no idea what it's like

202
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,958
to be on the receiving end.

203
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,500
"Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl

204
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:46,485
and everybody everywhere
wants to buy me drinks

205
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:48,066
and have sex with me."

206
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:48,955
Waa.

207
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:51,847
"Oh, poor me.
I get to order yummy, pink drinks

208
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,900
with chunks of real fruit
that guys secretly like,

209
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:55,675
but can't order because
they'll be made fun of."

210
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,374
- Dude.
- They're delicious!

211
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,910
Excuse me. Join me in a shot?

212
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:02,830
Oh, no thanks. I've had enough.

213
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,745
He's too in shape,

214
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:10,822
we'd spend all night talking
about his body fat content.

215
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:12,671
Now, if you'll excuse me,

216
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:15,876
I'm gonna go have a yummy,
pink drink with fruit in it...

217
00:09:16,011 --> 00:09:17,587
because I can.

218
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:21,324
You know, that was,
like, the third hot guy

219
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,037
that James blew off tonight.

220
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:25,469
Yeah, he's turning down shots,
he's yawning,

221
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:27,232
he's whining about his feet.

222
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:28,994
He's as bad as we are.

223
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:30,185
He is.

224
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:33,849
Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are.
You guys don't think that James is...

225
00:09:33,863 --> 00:09:35,228
in a relationship?

226
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:37,931
No. There's no way.
He's Barney's brother.

227
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:39,514
Look at that.

228
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,999
He's texting!

229
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:44,710
Oh, my God!

230
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:46,412
He is in a couple.

231
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,433
This is gonna kill Barney.

232
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:49,945
What's gonna kill me?

233
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:51,768
What's going on?

234
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:53,739
B-Barney?

235
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:58,015
Have you noticed anything...
different about James?

236
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:59,086
No.

237
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,261
I mean, he's glowing from his peel,
if that's what you mean.

238
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:06,553
We have reason to believe
that James is, uh,

239
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,067
maybe hiding
something from you.

240
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,418
I-I know you're not gonna
like hearing this, but...

241
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:11,869
Barney...

242
00:10:12,074 --> 00:10:14,084
your brother is...

243
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:16,704
monogamous.

244
00:10:17,873 --> 00:10:19,999
That's ridiculous!

245
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,601
Just because he's
a little sleepy,

246
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:25,827
and he hasn't had sex with
anyone in a bathroom stall...

247
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:31,173
He hasn't had sex with
anyone in a bathroom stall.

248
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:33,503
And, Barney...

249
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:36,336
I hate to be the one to
tell you this, but...

250
00:10:37,274 --> 00:10:38,791
he's texting.

251
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,143
No, he... No!

252
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,626
That... is impossible.

253
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:51,826
Excuse... Excuse... Ex...

254
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,247
Hey, bro.

255
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:55,950
Don't change the subject.

256
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,139
Let me see your phone.

257
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:57,901
Why?

258
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,602
I just want to see your phone.
Let me see your phone.

259
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:01,795
No, it's just a phone.
It's just a phone!

260
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,029
And it's got Internet access,
and it's got a camera on it,

261
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:05,790
and you can surf the Web
and do the whole thing.

262
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:08,351
It's so amazing how far
technology has come.

263
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,436
What kind of phone do you have?

264
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,624
I got...

265
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:16,763
Who is this?

266
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:20,125
And the answer better be:
"I don't remember his name."

267
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,408
That is Tom.

268
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:26,092
And he's my fiancé.

269
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:33,864
Hey.

270
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:37,187
I don't support this.

271
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:38,340
Gay marriage?

272
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:41,021
Not gay marriage-- marriage!

273
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:43,635
How can you do this?

274
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:46,559
We were raised in the same house,
with the same values!

275
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:50,014
Believe me,
I fought this for a long time.

276
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:52,076
Come on, it's embarrassing.

277
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:55,577
Look, this felt unnatural to me,
too, at first.

278
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:58,000
But I fell in love.

279
00:11:58,015 --> 00:12:00,644
And Tom and I realized
you can't fight love.

280
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:01,865
Oh, God.

281
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,339
Is that what you two do together?
You sit around the house

282
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:08,061
and talk about love?
I think... I'm gonna be sick.

283
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:09,794
Okay, okay, look,

284
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:11,478
I need you to wrap your
head around this, okay?

285
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:13,440
Because it is happening.

286
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:16,443
And I want you to
be my best man.

287
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:19,136
What? No way.

288
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,771
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

289
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,078
I hope you change your mind.

290
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:39,568
Two beers, one shot.

291
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,080
Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.

292
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:48,564
Oh, sweetie!
Did you make that for me?

293
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,396
Yes.

294
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:55,942
Clam Bake.
Staten Island. Who's in?

295
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:59,515
Okay, I didn't have high
hopes for that one.

296
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:01,418
Okay, here's my thing.

297
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:03,079
If gay guys start
getting married,

298
00:13:03,097 --> 00:13:05,404
then suddenly the whole
world's gonna be doing it.

299
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,014
That's how it works.
They start something,

300
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:09,727
then six months later,
everyone follows.

301
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:12,310
Like now everyone
gets manicures.

302
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,672
I don't get manicures.

303
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:16,816
Okay, then like how...
Like getting your chest waxed.

304
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,506
You get your chest waxed?

305
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:20,251
You know what I mean!

306
00:13:20,846 --> 00:13:23,193
Gay marriage is going
to cause single life,

307
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:25,387
as we know it, to die out.

308
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,860
Think of how the American
family will be strengthened.

309
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:31,150
Barney, I'm sorry you're upset,
but you got to suck it up

310
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:32,285
and be a man about this.

311
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:33,335
No.

312
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:37,060
It's always been me and him together,
being awesome,

313
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:39,510
while the rest of
you walked two-by-two

314
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,294
onto your ark of
sexless boredom.

315
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,135
Just because James
is getting married

316
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,949
doesn't mean things
are going to change.

317
00:13:45,963 --> 00:13:49,281
Yeah. Like things haven't
changed with you people.

318
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,627
Look, my sister married
a guy I didn't like.

319
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,057
Sandals and socks--
come on, buddy.

320
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:57,220
But I took her out,
we celebrated.

321
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,592
It was the right thing to do.

322
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:00,356
You got to support him.

323
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:04,168
You're right, Ted.

324
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:07,021
This is a cause
for celebration.

325
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:10,447
We need to take him out and
celebrate the commitment

326
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:12,756
he and Tom are about to make.

327
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:17,374
Yeah. This is where
we're celebrating

328
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,904
the commitment that Tom
and I are about to make?

329
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,238
What? Yeah!

330
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:24,461
See, that cage represents
your commitment.

331
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:33,701
Oh, my God. Freedom
has never tasted so delicious.

332
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:34,974
Hey.

333
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:36,636
You work out?

334
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,076
I do.

335
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,880
And thank you for noticing.

336
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:42,099
You're obviously in very
good shape yourself.

337
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,672
Well, I try.

338
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:45,286
So you want to dance?

339
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:48,008
You know what?
I'm very flattered, and, objectively,

340
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:51,190
you're a very attractive man,
but this is actually my fiancée.

341
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:53,853
I'm sorry.
You know, I saw your drink and I...

342
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:56,715
No, no, this isn't my drink.
This is hers.

343
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,578
No, it isn't.

344
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:00,439
Whatever.

345
00:15:00,454 --> 00:15:01,762
How 'bout you?

346
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:03,333
Oh, I'm straight, too.

347
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:05,288
But I thank you for your time,

348
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:08,291
and I appreciate your
interest in my body.

349
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:11,533
You see that?

350
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:13,574
Being hit on doesn't
have to be terrible.

351
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:16,757
I feel flattered,
and everyone left with their dignity.

352
00:15:18,947 --> 00:15:21,083
Hey, I really like
your sweater.

353
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:23,848
Wow. You actually do,
don't you?

354
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,298
You're not checking out
my boobs or anything.

355
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,643
My name's Gay Ken,
what do you think?

356
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:31,004
I love this place! Let's dance!

357
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,656
- And not be groped!
- Whoo! Thank you.

358
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:38,715
- Damn.
- Thank you!

359
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,808
- We're hot.
- Totally.

360
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:44,990
And then Tom says to the dealer

361
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:48,796
that the handmade Georgian
clock has a chip on the corner.

362
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:51,977
Blam, we get that puppy half price.
What up?!

363
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:53,261
Bam!

364
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:58,026
Sounds like you really rocked
that arts and crafts fair.

365
00:15:58,038 --> 00:15:59,425
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

366
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:02,318
Hey, oh, my God.
This is so liberating,

367
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:04,513
being able to talk
about this to you.

368
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:06,112
I cannot wait for
you to meet Tom.

369
00:16:06,127 --> 00:16:08,646
And I cannot wait for you
to meet my good friend...

370
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:10,047
this guy.

371
00:16:10,313 --> 00:16:12,461
Excuse me, do you know anyone
who would like to buy

372
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:15,476
my incredibly muscular, fun,
large-handed brother a drink?

373
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,448
Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you,
Barnaby. Okay.

374
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:24,614
All right. I spy a group of women
who have let their defenses down

375
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:26,448
because they are in a gay club.

376
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,037
You see that chick right there?

377
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:31,481
She looks like she'd fall for
sports agent and football player.

378
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:32,863
Okay, I'm in.

379
00:16:32,878 --> 00:16:34,396
Which one am I?

380
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,868
Please.

381
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:40,353
He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil,
and drops his pants

382
00:16:40,368 --> 00:16:42,966
after three dirty martinis.
Now go, man, go!

383
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:51,636
I just never thought I'd
see Barney so vulnerable.

384
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:54,406
Well, I guess no one wants to feel like
they're going through the world alone.

385
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,170
Look at me,
in a yummy sandwich!

386
00:16:57,184 --> 00:17:00,324
Okay, we're actually right in the
middle of something right now, so...

387
00:17:00,341 --> 00:17:03,189
Ooh, I know what I want to be
in the middle of. Thoughts?

388
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:05,589
God, can't two straight guys
come to a gay dance club,

389
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:08,343
enjoy some techno and good
conversation without being bothered?

390
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:14,902
How's it going, guys?
Still enjoying the attentions of men?

391
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,744
That's like the eighth guy
who's hit on us in ten minutes.

392
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:20,216
It's like, hello,
my eyes are up here.

393
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,676
And it's never the hot ones.

394
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:24,011
It's always the losers.
Bums me out!

395
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:26,575
Looks like the boys
learned their lesson.

396
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,206
Do you totally
miss being hit on?

397
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:30,019
Oh, totally.
Let's go find a sports bar.

398
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:34,493
James, James,
since you like arts and crafts,

399
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:38,116
look at what Charles here
made with cherry stems.

400
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:40,010
He did it with his tongue.

401
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,220
Yeah.

402
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:41,941
Barney.

403
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:45,232
So, Charles, why don't you put
your number in my brother's phone,

404
00:17:45,251 --> 00:17:46,457
and once he's in
a funner mood...

405
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:48,309
Barney, Barney,
I don't want his number.

406
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:51,130
I don't want anyone's
number, okay?

407
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:52,644
I'm getting married.

408
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,173
Wow.

409
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:56,346
- Best of luck to you both.
- Thank you.

410
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:57,930
My number's in here.

411
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,681
I'm very discreet.

412
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:02,785
Okay, okay, excuse me.

413
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,535
Barney, family talk.

414
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,707
Okay, dude,
you have got to stop this, okay?

415
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:09,670
I know that my getting married is
threatening to your way of life...

416
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:11,212
Oh, so now it's my way of life?

417
00:18:11,227 --> 00:18:13,407
I thought it was
our way of life.

418
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,628
You've completely
turned your back on it.

419
00:18:15,643 --> 00:18:17,349
Look at you,
not even suited up.

420
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:19,702
Do you remember why
we suit up, James?

421
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:20,934
To get laid.

422
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,996
To show people that
we are different

423
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:26,440
from the millions of T-shirt
and jeans lemmings out there.

424
00:18:26,454 --> 00:18:29,041
The suit shows that we are
a force to be reckoned with,

425
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:31,586
a two-person army that
plays by its own rules.

426
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,108
But you've taken off the uniform,
you've crossed enemy lines,

427
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,289
and you've abandoned me.

428
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:36,660
Well, I'm not gonna
let you do that.

429
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:40,356
It's not too late to back out
of this stupid marriage thing!

430
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:42,027
You don't have to do this, bro!

431
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:43,299
- Yes, I do.
- Why?!

432
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:45,921
Because Tom and I are
gonna have a baby.

433
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:47,972
What? There's gonna be a baby?

434
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:52,289
Yes. We're adopting.

435
00:18:52,413 --> 00:18:56,014
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna be an uncle?

436
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,915
For the rest of your life.

437
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:03,893
And that's how Barney
became Uncle Barney.

438
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,914
A year later,
at James's wedding,

439
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:07,845
Barney could not have
been more proud.

440
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:09,528
To James and Tom.

441
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,109
May you have a long and
happy life together.

442
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:15,333
And may I always have the skin
and libido of a much younger man.

443
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:16,916
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

444
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,100
Nice one.

445
00:19:19,554 --> 00:19:22,511
Thanks. I decided to leave
out the hetero college phase.

446
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:23,932
No one wants to
hear about that.

447
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:25,324
It was perfect.

448
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:27,579
You even made Tom's dad cry.

449
00:19:27,594 --> 00:19:30,542
Might have been doing that
because he's a Republican.

450
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,102
Whoa.

451
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:34,596
It's 9:00.

452
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:37,079
We should be getting back.
You guys want to split a cab?

453
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,981
Uh, no, I think I'm gonna
stay a little bit longer.

454
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:41,083
Yeah, me, too.
I'm not tired at all.

455
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:43,394
All right, well, it's getting late.
Got to get the wife home.

456
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:45,749
Oh, stop calling me that.
It makes me sound fat.

457
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:49,583
Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.

458
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:05,761
- May I?
- Yeah.

459
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:13,507
Hey, buddy.

460
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,651
Your parents are married.

461
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:17,561
Now, listen, you.

462
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:20,105
Just because you're being
raised by married people

463
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,629
doesn't mean you have to
choose that lifestyle.

464
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:23,771
High-five.

465
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:26,754
Luckily, you got me.

466
00:20:26,918 --> 00:20:30,426
In 20 and a half years,
you'll be 21,

467
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:32,289
and I will be...

468
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:35,051
Well, I haven't decided
how old I'll be yet.

469
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:39,419
But we are gonna bro out,
uncle and nephew style.

470
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:41,100
Stick with me, kid.

471
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,153
I am gonna teach
you how to live.

472
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,305
Great suit, by the way.

473
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:52,362
Who is the cutest?

474
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:01,462
I don't get it.

475
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:04,574
Tom liked my breasts
in tenth grade.

476
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:07,557
Why doesn't he like them now?

477
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:09,811
Why?

478
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:14,055
Rosa, why always be attracted
to the unavailable ones?

479
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,338
Why not accept the fact that
you're a beautiful woman

480
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:18,382
who is worthy of love?

481
00:21:18,396 --> 00:21:20,672
Are you brave enough
to hear that?

482
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,905
You...
