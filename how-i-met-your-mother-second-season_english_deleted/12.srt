1
00:00:00,923 --> 00:00:03,149
Kids, you remember
my first day with Robin.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,722
- I think I'm in love with you.
- What?!

3
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:09,554
Well, here's the thing, normal people,
you know, people who aren't your dad,

4
00:00:09,554 --> 00:00:12,234
usually take longer to say "I love you."

5
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:14,427
Robin went through the usual stages.

6
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:18,401
- Spider! Spider!
- I left something in the hallway.

7
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:20,484
- Where?
- Right there.

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,288
Got it.

9
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,730
First there's the moment
when you think you think it.

10
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:26,127
Whoa, still alive.

11
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:30,215
There's the moment
you think you know it.

12
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:32,861
Oh, you don't want to kiss me,
you'll get sick.

13
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:42,649
Totally worth it.

14
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:47,572
There's the moment where you know
you know it,  but you can't yet say it.

15
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:50,450
All right, it's getting to be that time.
I'll talk to you tomorrow?

16
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:51,831
Good night.

17
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:53,276
Good night.

18
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:55,459
Wait, Ted?

19
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:56,300
Yeah?

20
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:00,038
Good night.

21
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:04,409
Well, great, I'll see you then.

22
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,763
Bye, sweetie.

23
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:07,153
Hey. Guess what?

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,139
My sister Katie is coming
to visit next weekend.

25
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:10,360
She gets in on Thursday.

26
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:12,145
That's awesome.
You know what I'm going to do?

27
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,346
I'm going to take off work Friday.

28
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,222
We're gonna take her
to the Empire State Building.

29
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:17,387
Really? You'd do that?

30
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,393
Of course. Everyone should see
the Empire State Building.

31
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:23,880
And then there's the moment
where you know you know it,

32
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,903
and you can't keep it in any longer.

33
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,496
- Ted.
- Yeah?

34
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:30,855
Falafel.

35
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,467
Sync by vNaru

36
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,859
- Falafel?
- Falafel.

37
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:55,285
Instead of telling Ted you love him,
you said "falafel"?

38
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,933
- I totally choked.
- I just don't get it.

39
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,276
Why can't you tell Ted you love him?

40
00:02:00,283 --> 00:02:02,160
Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.

41
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:05,738
Oh, God, you'd think you never
said it to a guy before.

42
00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:08,385
No.

43
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:11,351
Okay, well, I don't usually get
this far in the relationship.

44
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:13,363
I usually take the three-week exit.

45
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:17,022
Don't tell me you're actually buying
into Barney's freeway theory.

46
00:02:17,256 --> 00:02:21,391
Watch your steps when you get up, kids,
'cause I am about to drop some knowledge.

47
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,445
Relationships are like a freeway.

48
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,094
Wait a minute, a month ago you told me
relationships are like a traveling circus.

49
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:29,087
No, this is new.
This trumps that.

50
00:02:29,392 --> 00:02:32,024
Freeways have exits.
So do relationships.

51
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:34,778
The first exit, my personal favorite,
is six hours in.

52
00:02:34,784 --> 00:02:37,676
You meet, you talk, you have sex,
you exit when she's in the shower.

53
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:41,464
So every girl you have sex with feels
the immediate need to shower?

54
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:43,587
Actually, yeah, I get that.

55
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:47,887
The next exits are four days,
three weeks, seven months--

56
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:49,748
that's when you guys are gonna
break up, mark your calendars.

57
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:50,470
What?

58
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:54,239
Then a year and a half, 18 years,
and the last exit-- death.

59
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:56,325
Which, if you've been with the same woman
for your entire life,

60
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,719
it's like, "Are we there yet?"

61
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:02,286
So I've never been on the freeway
this long before.

62
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:05,802
I mean, usually by now I find out
the guy has some weird personality thing

63
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:07,496
that makes me want
to take the next exit.

64
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:08,647
Yeah, been there.

65
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:14,051
I once dated a guy who could only go to
the bathroom when classical music was playing.

66
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:15,913
Okay, it was Marshall.

67
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,214
It's just things are going so well with
Ted I just don't want to complicate it.

68
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,622
Relax, it'll happen when it happens.

69
00:03:23,677 --> 00:03:28,268
Which is also the advice I gave Marshall
to get him over the classical music thing.

70
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,634
Oh, here comes Katie.

71
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,765
- Aw, your sister's so cute.
- Yeah.

72
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,931
This reminds me of when I used to see
her coming up the driveway from school,

73
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:42,338
with her little pigtails
and her Hello Kitty backpack.

74
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:46,488
- Hello, Kitty.
- Oh, no.

75
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:48,901
No. No. No.

76
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,317
- Hey, Robin. How are you?
- Oh, good. Good.

77
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:59,337
So, who is this... tongue person?

78
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:01,680
Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.

79
00:04:02,418 --> 00:04:04,847
Looks like hotness runs in the family.

80
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:08,115
Oh, you said that.
Great.

81
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:10,520
So how long have you two been...?

82
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:11,881
- Two whole months.
- Yeah.

83
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:14,228
He's actually coming to visit
family in New York, too.

84
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:15,319
Isn't that great?

85
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:19,409
My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad,
but he buys me beer, so...

86
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,483
That's cool.
This is my friend Lily.

87
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,947
Hot.

88
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:25,633
You say things!

89
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:29,780
Well, come on, let's get you back
to my place, we'll get you settled.

90
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:32,096
Um, actually, I'm going
to stay with Kyle tonight.

91
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,119
- Uh, no, you're not.
- Oh, come on.

92
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:37,033
It's kind of a special night.

93
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:38,366
If you know what I mean.

94
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:40,113
What?

95
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:42,448
Oh. Oh...

96
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:50,273
I can't believe my baby sister is planning
to lose her virginity to a...

97
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:52,377
...douche with a faux hawk.

98
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:54,119
This can't happen.

99
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:56,435
You guys have to help me
talk her out of it.

100
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:59,663
Speech to talk a girl out of having sex.

101
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:01,407
Yeah, I don't have any of those.

102
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:04,340
Discouraging premarital sex
is against my religion.

103
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,478
Please? I'm her older sister.

104
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:10,152
I'm supposed to teach her how to make
good and responsible decisions.

105
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:13,802
It's 2:00 and you've already
had three scotch and sodas.

106
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:15,625
That's why I need your help.

107
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:20,528
Robin convinced Katie to stay with her
that first night.

108
00:05:20,572 --> 00:05:23,455
And the next day, I took everybody
to the Empire State Building.

109
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,577
You guys are lucky
you came here with an architect.

110
00:05:25,582 --> 00:05:27,373
Empire State Building fun
fact number one:

111
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:29,946
When construction began
on March 17, 1930,

112
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:33,105
the framework rose at a rate
of four and a half stories per week.

113
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,858
Four and a half stories per week.

114
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,027
Four and a half stories per week.

115
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:41,642
There it is.
There it is. Come on.

116
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:44,417
These are fun facts, guys,
let's have fun with them.

117
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:49,506
You know, Katie, I have wanted to come
to the Empire State Building for so long,

118
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:52,225
but I waited to come here
with someone special.

119
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,836
Oh, here we go.

120
00:05:53,943 --> 00:05:57,486
Marshall and I have never been to
the Empire State Building either.

121
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,144
But I'm so glad I waited to do something
so important with my fiancé.

122
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:05,591
Speaking of waiting, I signed
an abstinence pledge in high school.

123
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:07,336
It's totally cool to wait.

124
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,412
And stay away from drugs...
other than pot.

125
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:13,719
- You told them?
- Oh, okay, yes, I told them.

126
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:16,835
But only because I think you should
hear it from other grownups, too.

127
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:19,219
Everyone thinks you should wait.
Right, guys?

128
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:21,124
- Totally. You should wait.
- Sex is fun.

129
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,886
See?

130
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:25,914
You are such a hypocrite.
You were only 16 when you lost yours.

131
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,188
Well, how do you know that?

132
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:29,652
You left your diary in your old room
slash my new room.

133
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,896
I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.

134
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:35,315
Look, I've been dating Kyle
for two months now.

135
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,687
It's like forever.

136
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,131
I mean, we've already done
everything else.

137
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:41,414
- I mean, we've even...
- Oh. La, la, la, la, la.

138
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,413
La, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la.

139
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:49,203
Even Kyle gets to do that.

140
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,936
You have no right to tell me
not to do it.

141
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:54,271
But Kyle?
Why can't you just wait?

142
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:57,431
Because if you wait,
you can get a nice guy like Ted.

143
00:06:57,655 --> 00:06:59,905
Robin, this is happening.

144
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,049
Look, I already put it up
on my Myspace page.

145
00:07:04,044 --> 00:07:06,476
- I need a clove.
- You smoke now, too?

146
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,741
- Oh, remember cloves?
- No!

147
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:11,477
No "Aw, remember cloves?"
This can't happen.

148
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,235
She's my baby sister, okay?

149
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:18,146
She should be watching The Little Mermaid
and drinking Yoohoo, and not having sex.

150
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,281
Come on, you were only 16
when you had sex.

151
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:22,156
- I was 17.
- We were 18.

152
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:23,909
Barney was probably 12.

153
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:25,971
Good one, Ted.

154
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,380
I was, uh, six... fourt...

155
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:30,983
How old were you again?

156
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,648
- 17.
- Dude, me, too.

157
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:36,503
- Barney, you okay?
- Yeah, of course.

158
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:37,919
What, you don't believe me?

159
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,204
- It was at camp, so I'm...
- What camp?

160
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:42,627
This place in the Catskills.
Look it up.

161
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:45,602
I was there teaching for the summer.

162
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:47,569
What did you teach?

163
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:49,511
Uh, dance.

164
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:50,664
Dance?

165
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:53,190
Yeah, Ted, dance.
Maybe you've heard of it.

166
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:58,332
It was just a simple summer job,
but it turned into so much more.

167
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:03,070
Her name was Frances Houseman,
but everyone called her Baby.

That's Dirty Dancing.

179
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:32,049
- It was on last night.
- No, it was two nights ago.

180
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,556
"She's Like the Wind" has been stuck
in my brain for about 40 hours.

181
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:36,348
I just got it out.
Now it's back in.

182
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:38,614
Damn you, Swayze!

183
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:43,114
- Do you remember our first time?
- Yeah.

184
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,389
It was back in college.

185
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:48,022
Oh, wait, wait.

186
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:51,250
Look... I really want to do this, but...

187
00:08:51,317 --> 00:08:53,807
we should make it special, you know?

188
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:55,078
Do this right.

189
00:08:58,511 --> 00:08:59,307
Okay.

190
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:00,551
You're right.

191
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:03,959
Maybe we could go to the beach
and get a house for the weekend.

192
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:06,332
Yeah, New Year's Eve.

193
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:07,916
Okay.

194
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:13,979
Oh, and we'll light candles and
maybe put on some classical music.

195
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,512
That's not a good idea.

196
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:16,946
Why not?

197
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,487
Long story.

198
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:21,666
But maybe we could put on some Al Green
and take a bubble bath together.

199
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:24,418
Oh, yeah, that sounds so good.

200
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:26,884
Oh, I love you, Marshall.

201
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,382
I'm so glad we're waiting.

202
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:33,319
Oops.

203
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:37,766
- Oh, that's adorable.
- Yeah, tell her what happened next.

204
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:40,474
- That was amazing.
- Yeah.

205
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,277
Want to do it again?

206
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:43,681
Please don't.

207
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,609
- We said we were sorry.
- Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?

208
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:50,783
You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.

209
00:09:50,788 --> 00:09:55,914
The point is no matter what, it's never
gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.

210
00:09:55,922 --> 00:09:57,199
Well, mine was terrible.

211
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:59,331
Wait, I've never heard your story.

212
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:03,022
Well, as you know, I was 16.

213
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,788
And it was with my boyfriend Brian.

214
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,427
- Ready?
- Yeah.

215
00:10:13,718 --> 00:10:16,448
- This feels so right.
- Oh, I know.

216
00:10:16,454 --> 00:10:19,206
- Oh, Robin.
- Oh, Brian.

217
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:23,692
Yeah, I'm gay.

218
00:10:25,604 --> 00:10:29,145
- I'm so sorry.
- Eh, I should've known.

219
00:10:29,802 --> 00:10:31,338
There were signs.

220
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:33,175
Oh, my God!

221
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,706
My mom's home.
Quick!

222
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,501
- Get under my bed.
- What?!

223
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:39,416
Oh, my God!

224
00:10:40,976 --> 00:10:43,947
You only get one shot
at losing your virginity.

225
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,822
And even though I just barely had sex,
it counts.

226
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:48,696
What do you mean just barely?

227
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:52,635
Well, he didn't dive all
the way into the pool, but he...

228
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:55,220
splashed around in the shallow end.

229
00:10:56,027 --> 00:10:58,626
Then you didn't lose
your virginity to him.

230
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,233
- Just barely doesn't count.
- Yes, it does.

231
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:02,453
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

232
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,570
No, it doesn't. It doesn't count.
End of story.

233
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:09,719
Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin,
you saucy little harlot.

234
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:14,661
Could it be that before Marshall took
a swim, someone else tested the water?

235
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:18,577
No. Nobody else tested the water, right?

236
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:21,166
Scooter?

237
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,267
Who's Scooter?

238
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:24,831
My high school boyfriend,
who I did not have sex with.

239
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,389
I... I can't believe this.

240
00:11:27,523 --> 00:11:29,811
We're Marshall and Lily--
when people see us, they say,

241
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:32,998
"Oh, look at them, they've only
had sex with each other."

242
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:35,687
No, Marshall, they say,
"Oh, look at them,

243
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:38,009
they've only had sex with each other."

244
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,355
But now that's not true anymore--

245
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,460
now you've had sex with twice
as many people as I have.

246
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:45,727
I knew that you were too good at it.

247
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:48,812
Know what? I don't want to see
the stupid Empire State Building anymore.

248
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:51,680
- It's not stupid.
- I'm going to see Kyle.

249
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:55,337
Katie, please.
You only get to lose your virginity once.

250
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:57,843
You should only be having sex
with someone who's special.

251
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,535
Oh, please-- you've had sex with,
like, a hundred guys.

252
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,845
It's not a hundred guys.
It's not a hundred guys.

253
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,468
I'm sure you were madly
in love with all of them.

254
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:09,738
I had different levels of feeling
for each of the...

255
00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:11,862
very reasonable number of guys.

256
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:13,616
Really.

257
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:15,579
Well, do you love Ted?

258
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:23,767
Do you love Ted ?

259
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:25,900
I, um...

260
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:28,814
Okay, Empire State Building
fun fact number 22:

261
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:33,144
The Empire State Building has tons of places
where people can have private conversations.

262
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:36,042
- You're off the hook, okay?
- Just let me explain.

263
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,600
You don't have to explain anything.
You don't have to say it-- it's fine.

264
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:44,307
Okay, but if relationships are
like a freeway, then saying...

265
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:48,846
"hm hm hm" is like...
getting into the carpool lane.

266
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:51,615
And I don't want to take an exit, but...

267
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,721
at the same time, I'm not ready
to get into the carpool lane.

268
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:56,464
Because what's in the carpool lane?

269
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,550
Oh, it's a big diamond,
and I'm just not ready to get...

270
00:12:59,565 --> 00:13:01,352
Okay, Robin, Robin, stop.

271
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:03,959
It's no big deal--
you don't have to say it.

272
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:08,290
It's just, it's a big thing to say to
someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.

273
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,952
What, you mean like I did?

274
00:13:09,985 --> 00:13:11,496
No. I didn't...

275
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,849
Yeah, like you did.

276
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,358
I mean, you have to admit it,
Ted, it was a little weird.

277
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:22,189
- Weird... or courageous?
- Pretty sure weird.

278
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:25,325
I mean, who gives it up
on the first date?

279
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:27,619
Well, come on, it shows I'm brave
and bold, like a knight.

280
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:30,123
No, it shows that
you're an I-love-you slut.

281
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:32,150
Well, then you're an I-love-you prude.

282
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:33,751
You know what?
I take mine back.

283
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:35,336
- You... What?
- I take my "I love you" back.

284
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:37,981
- You can't take it back.
- Nah. Just did. Got it right here.

285
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:40,155
But, you know, I'm such a slut,
I'm just gonna give it away.

286
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:42,279
Hey, you, sir. I love you.

287
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:44,011
Thank you, man.

288
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,148
I was going up there to jump.

289
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,382
Marshall, why is this such a big deal?

290
00:13:52,494 --> 00:13:54,794
Why is this such a big deal?

291
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,504
Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus,
guess who actually discovered the New World.

292
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:01,020
Some dude named Scooter.

293
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,392
Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong,
it actually goes like this:

294
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,443
"One small step for man,
one giant leap for Scooter."

295
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:09,618
Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve

296
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,109
- before you did...
- Okay, Marshall, I get it.

297
00:14:11,156 --> 00:14:13,575
It's a big deal because
it rewrites our history.

298
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:14,809
No, it doesn't.

299
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:17,703
Look, have you been to
the Empire State Building?

300
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:19,919
No. You've only been in the lobby.

301
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,203
People don't buy tickets
to get in the lobby.

302
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:23,888
They buy tickets to get to the top.

303
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:27,362
Scooter only got in the lobby,
and the lobby doesn't count.

304
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:28,294
Really.

305
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,654
Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me
how to get to the Empire State Building?

306
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,606
Um, we're in it right now.

307
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:36,414
Thank you, sir.
You're a very wise and brilliant man.

308
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,257
You're right.

309
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,179
Why would I throw that all away?

310
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,575
I'm having the best day!

311
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:46,814
Katie, I'll admit,
maybe I'm not in any place

312
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:50,042
to lecture you on romantic
relationships, but...

313
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:53,317
but I just don't want you to make
the same mistakes that I've made.

314
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:57,956
- Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay.
- That's not what I meant.

315
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:02,034
I just wish you weren't
in such a rush to grow up.

316
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:05,010
Please don't do this.

317
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:09,561
But, kids, later that night,
Katie did it,

318
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:13,488
and she got pregnant...
with quintuplets...

319
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:16,598
and she lived out her days
in a trailer park...

320
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:18,992
where she died an alcoholic.

321
00:15:19,176 --> 00:15:22,550
So the moral here, kids,
don't have sex until you're married.

322
00:15:22,615 --> 00:15:24,602
Maybe even, like,
a year or two into marriage.

323
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,806
- Dad!
- Come on, what really happened?

324
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:28,890
All right, here's what really happened.

325
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:30,186
- Hey.
- Hey.

326
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:31,798
She didn't do it.

327
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:34,021
Hey, that's great!
You got through to her.

328
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:36,458
No, I didn't. You did.

329
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,441
She told me that you talked to her.

330
00:15:39,618 --> 00:15:40,494
Hey, Katie.

331
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:42,028
Hey.

332
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:44,954
Got another Empire State
Building fun fact for me?

333
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:47,850
No. I wouldn't bore you
with the seven million man-hours

334
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:51,228
it took to build this 102-story
testament to human will.

335
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:54,794
So, you okay?

336
00:15:54,982 --> 00:15:57,151
I don't know what everyone
is freaking out about.

337
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,517
Kyle, he's a really nice guy.

338
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,892
He could've cheated on me with my lab
partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't.

339
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:05,898
'Cause he said he knew I'd find out.

340
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:08,664
That's very gallant.

341
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:11,460
Well, I don't know what your sister's
freaking out about, either.

342
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,617
- I was your age my first time.
- Oh, really?

343
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,261
Yeah, yeah. It was, uh,
it was with this girl, Molly.

344
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,918
I love you, Ted.

345
00:16:20,005 --> 00:16:22,275
Oh, I love you, too, Molly.

346
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,687
But I didn't.

347
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:26,794
That was amazing.

348
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,698
Look, I got to go.

349
00:16:29,515 --> 00:16:31,103
Where are you going?

350
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,908
My cousin got some firecrackers
from Mexico.

351
00:16:34,014 --> 00:16:36,193
We're going out to the woods to light 'em--
it's gonna be awesome.

352
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:37,804
Well, will you call me?

353
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:41,103
Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you.

354
00:16:41,156 --> 00:16:43,236
But I didn't.

355
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:46,433
Molly?

356
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:47,786
Yeah?

357
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:50,554
Can I borrow 20 bucks?
I'll totally pay you back.

358
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:52,516
But I didn't.

359
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:55,632
And I never saw her again.

360
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:59,190
I told her I loved her, but...
I just wanted to have sex.

361
00:16:59,237 --> 00:17:01,986
I-I would've said anything
to make that happen, and...

362
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:03,810
that's exactly what I did.

363
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:07,827
Look, I'm not telling you what to do.

364
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:10,966
I'm just telling you what
all 17-year-old boys are like.

365
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:13,138
Even the nice ones.

366
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:19,421
So I told Kyle I wanted to wait...
and he dumped me.

367
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:23,169
Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

368
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,006
Aw, honey.

369
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,301
I promise everything is gonna be okay.

370
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:37,351
You want to watch The Little Mermaid
and drink some YooHoo?

371
00:17:38,477 --> 00:17:40,957
Only if you put a buttload
of Kahlua in it.

372
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:43,252
Don't tell Mom.

373
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:47,018
Thanks for doing that.

374
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:49,695
You're welcome.
I knew it meant a lot to you.

375
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:53,152
But, man, your story, I mean,
it doesn't even sound like you.

376
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:55,575
Yeah, well...

377
00:17:58,507 --> 00:17:59,867
I love you, Molly.

378
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:02,421
Oh, I love you, too, Ted.

379
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:06,480
Wow. That was amazing.

380
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,505
Look, I got to go.

381
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,688
Wh-Where are you going?

382
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:13,293
Uh, my cousin got
some firecrackers from Mexico.

383
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:15,095
We're going into the woods
to light them.

384
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,501
It's gonna be awesome.

385
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:18,152
Will you call me?

386
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:20,298
Yeah. I'll totally call you.

387
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,255
- Oh, Ted?
- Yeah?

388
00:18:24,883 --> 00:18:27,833
Can I borrow 20 bucks?
I'll totally pay you back.

389
00:18:29,223 --> 00:18:32,402
- But she didn't.
- Oh, come here.

390
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:39,327
I love you.

391
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,929
I said it.

392
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:46,904
Feels right.

393
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:49,938
- I love you.
- I'm gay.

394
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,865
I'm kidding.

395
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,000
I love you, too.

396
00:18:57,749 --> 00:19:00,904
Hey... you lost
your I-love-you-ginity.

397
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,073
Yeah.

398
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:05,252
I guess I was just waiting
for the right guy.

399
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:14,179
Katie ended up having
a great first time in New York.

400
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:18,428
And the last thing we did before she left
was go to the Empire State Building.

401
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:20,703
I am so glad we're finally doing this.

402
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:22,286
What are you talking about?
We were here yesterday.

403
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:23,872
Yeah, but that didn't really count.

404
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,409
- Oh, crap.
- Exactly!

405
00:19:27,514 --> 00:19:31,658
So yesterday doesn't count as having
gone to the Empire State Building.

406
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:34,102
So I lost it to you, Marshall.

407
00:19:34,177 --> 00:19:37,058
And I rode that elevator to the top,

408
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:41,325
and I saw that view,
and I basked in the awesomeness.

409
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,280
And that's our story.

410
00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:45,856
Yeah. Yeah, that's our story.

411
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:48,032
We've only had sex with each other.

412
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:50,116
We've only had sex with each other.

413
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,460
They've only had sex with each other.

414
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,410
Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go.

415
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:01,319
Okay, Empire State Building
fun fact number 81:

416
00:20:01,385 --> 00:20:04,817
There are 1,860 steps from this...
Whoa, whoa! Come on!

417
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:14,411
So, now you guys can finally say you've
been to the Empire State Building.

418
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:16,928
How have you lived here so long
and never been to the top?

419
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:20,284
Well, we're usually busy... drinking.

420
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,062
Speaking of first times,
we never got to hear

421
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:27,307
- your virginity story.
- That's right, I almost forgot.

422
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:31,937
Okay. I was 16,
and it was in a baseball dugout...

423
00:20:31,975 --> 00:20:33,092
Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

424
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:35,135
I mean, I was in a subway
with a high-priced call girl...

425
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:35,927
Risky Business.

426
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:38,151
I was accidentally hacking
into NORAD'S computer...

427
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:40,387
That's War Games, and there's not even
a sex scene in it.

428
00:20:40,391 --> 00:20:41,737
All right!

429
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:47,152
I was 23, and it was with my mom's
45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda.

430
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:49,596
She called me "Barry" the whole time,
and for two weeks,

431
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,813
my comforter smelled like menthol
cigarettes. You happy?

432
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,558
Hey...

433
00:21:01,824 --> 00:21:05,527
Why don't you tell us again about your
first time at the camp in the Catskills.

434
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:09,676
Baby and her family spent
every summer at Kellerman's.

435
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:11,752
Her dad did not approve of our love.

436
00:21:11,946 --> 00:21:15,170
- Did anyone put Baby in a corner?
- Oh, God, no.

437
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:17,974
What can I say, I...

438
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:20,910
had... the time of my life.

439
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:22,864
True story.
