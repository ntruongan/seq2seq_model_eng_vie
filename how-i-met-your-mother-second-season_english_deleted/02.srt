1
00:00:00,718 --> 00:00:04,056
Marshall and Lily had been
together for nine wonderful years,

2
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:06,826
until she dumped him and
ran off to San Francisco.

3
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:10,211
The healing process
was taking a long time.

4
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:14,453
Then, one night,
he made a giant leap forward.

5
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:16,091
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

6
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:17,230
I'll walk you out.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,474
See ya.

8
00:00:22,764 --> 00:00:24,855
You just checked
out Robin's ass.

9
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:26,937
What? No! No, Barney, I was...

10
00:00:26,948 --> 00:00:28,940
Dude, that's awesome.

11
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:32,039
You're finally forgetting
about that short redhead.

12
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:32,780
Lily.

13
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:35,977
Yes, Lily. Thank you. That was
going to drive me crazy all night.

14
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:38,222
Hey, Ted, Marshall just checked
out your girlfriend's ass.

15
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:40,871
- I did not, Ted, I...
- That's awesome.

16
00:00:40,887 --> 00:00:42,291
You're finally getting better.

17
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:44,172
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

18
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:47,612
Starting tonight,
I am going to teach you how to live.

19
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:49,590
Ted, you had your chance.
You're out; Marshall's in.

20
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:50,943
- Yes!
- Oh, God.

21
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:54,793
Marshall, being a single guy
in New York City is like...

22
00:00:55,617 --> 00:00:57,243
What's something
everybody likes?

23
00:00:57,255 --> 00:00:58,261
Candy.

24
00:00:58,277 --> 00:01:00,803
Yes, it's like being
in a candy store.

25
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:04,122
You just walk right in and
grab yourself some Whoppers.

26
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:06,537 --> 00:01:08,103
Is Whoppers the best one?

28
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:09,193
Mounds.

29
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:10,523
Milk Duds.

30
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:12,170
Gobstoppers.

31
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:15,211
This went on for another hour;

32
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:16,691
I'll just skip to the end.

33
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:18,731
- Dubble Bubbles.
- Nice!

34
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:20,453
Marshall. We're doing this.

35
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:22,390
I am not taking
no for an answer.

36
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:23,671
Fine.

37
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:25,790
Hey, Robin.
Marshall checked out your ass.

38
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:27,342
Ted, what is wrong with you?

39
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:29,012
He checked out my ass.

40
00:01:29,027 --> 00:01:32,552
Hey, tell him thanks.
I felt like I was having a bad ass day.

41
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:34,520
Cool, see ya.

42
00:01:37,655 --> 00:01:39,132
Lily.

43
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,432
It is a great ass.

44
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:44,389
Sync by vNaru

45
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:57,382
None of us had seen
Lily in three months.

46
00:01:57,398 --> 00:01:59,393
There were so many
unanswered questions,

47
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:01,013
so many things to say.

48
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:03,723
Your hair is adorable.

49
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:08,320
Meanwhile, Barney was taking
Marshall out to meet women

50
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,883
for the first time
since he was 17.

51
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:13,150
Hi. Have you met Marshall?

52
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:15,353
- Hi.
- Hi.

53
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:19,523
Look how sweaty my hands are.

54
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:22,980
It's weird, right? Uh, sweat?

55
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:26,962
Like, this smelly water
coming out of your skin.

56
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,702
It was nice meeting you.

57
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,461
I-I-I hate to interrupt,
but, uh,

58
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:35,350
do you like magic?

59
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,433
Um, I guess.

60
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:41,761
Oh, my God!

61
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:48,481
Anyway, Marshall
here is awesome.

62
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:50,761
Salad in a bag? His idea.

63
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,693
Dude! You were
awesome last night.

64
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,410
You were charming,
you were funny,

65
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:57,160
you were totally
working that girl.

66
00:02:57,175 --> 00:02:58,561
You went home with her.

67
00:02:58,575 --> 00:03:00,423
Yes, I did.

68
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:03,722
But she told me that
if it wasn't for me,

69
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:05,260
you would have had
a shot with her,

70
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:08,122
so, in hypothetical terms,
you scored last night.

71
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:09,360
All right!

72
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:11,242
Hypothetical high five.

73
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:14,243
Nice.

74
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:16,583
All right.
Tonight, we're going to go to the bar...

75
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,330
Barney, no,
I am not going out with you ever again.

76
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:22,143
Come on! I'll,
I'll teach you all of my strategies.

77
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:22,931
Oh, really?

78
00:03:22,948 --> 00:03:25,083
My favorite, number seven:

79
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:26,993
create a mystery
about yourself.

80
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,772
That way, they become so intrigued, they
have to hang out with you all night.

81
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:32,820
Oh, come on,
does that really work?

82
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,841
Maybe it does,
and maybe it doesn't.

83
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:40,950
Damn it, that's intriguing.
Okay, I'm in.

84
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:46,100
- I have something you've got to hear.
- You will not believe what just happened.

85
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:47,713
You go first.

86
00:03:48,757 --> 00:03:51,623
I found a 1939d
penny on the subway.

87
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:54,600
Just imagine the kind of history
this little copper guy...

88
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:56,262
Lily's back in town.

89
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:58,903
And you let me go first?

90
00:03:58,918 --> 00:03:59,882
Have you seen her?

91
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:03,370
Yeah. I actually went
apartment-hunting with her today.

92
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:04,943
How's she doing?

93
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:06,692
You're not going to like it.

94
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:09,210
I am doing great.

95
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:11,362
This summer, best thing ever!

96
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,130
San Francisco is so
happening right now.

97
00:04:14,148 --> 00:04:15,691
She's happy?!

98
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:19,010
Marshall had the worst summer
of his life, and she's happy.

99
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:23,443
Yeah, and I suppose her art program
was all fulfilling or whatever.

100
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:27,161
Oh. The art program--
best thing ever.

101
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:29,091
Oh, my God.

102
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:30,971
This is your best work.

103
00:04:30,985 --> 00:04:34,140
In all my years teaching,
I've never seen anything so...

104
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,840
Needless to say, this is art.

105
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:42,181
I can't teach you anything.

106
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,641
But the best part of S.F.--

107
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:49,830
Oh, that's what we
call San Francisco--

108
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:50,972
the people.

109
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:53,231
Even just riding around
on the bus all summer.

110
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:56,593
It was like a human tapestry.

111
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:58,231
Hi, I'm Mike.

112
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:01,312
I'm a Buddhist monk slash
adventure-traveler writer.

113
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:04,860
I'm Paula.
I sing in a punk band for children.

114
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:06,192
Yeah.

115
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm Dan, I'm a neurosurgeon.

116
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,230
You are stunning, by the way.

117
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:15,082
Wow. I'm so happy for you.

118
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,672
Oh, she's such a...

119
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:22,723
After what she did to Marshall,
she should come back here devastated,

120
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:26,480
crawling on all fours over the broken
glass of her own shame and regret.

121
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,823
You never chose sides.
I respect that.

122
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:30,581
She's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

123
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:32,992
Unbelievable?
What's unbelievable?

124
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:34,352
Oh. Listen, Marshall.

125
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:38,302
Ted found a penny on the subway,
and it's old, and that's interesting.

126
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:42,952
Way to go.

127
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:48,690
Okay, first of all,
that is interesting.

128
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:50,160
Second, we have to tell him.

129
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:53,841
No, we don't. He's just starting to
get better, going out with Barney.

130
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:57,111
I mean, how do you think he's going to
feel when he hears Lily's moved on?

131
00:05:57,126 --> 00:05:59,471
- She's moved on?
- It happens.

132
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,590
I've fallen out of love
faster than that before,

133
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:04,213
sometimes, boom,
with no warning whatsoever.

134
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:07,283
One day we're in love,
the next day, he's dead to me.

135
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:10,471
But we're great.

136
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,192
Honey.

137
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:17,661
Now, let's review Barney's
rules for mating without dating.

138
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:20,212
Lesson two, corollary five.

139
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:23,590
Make a beautiful woman feel
self-conscious and unattractive

140
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:24,960
and she'll be putty
in your hands.

141
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,420
Excellent. Have you
chosen your entree?

142
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:30,283
I have.
Sweet brunette, eight o'clock.

143
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,061
Nine o'clock. Ten... thirty.

144
00:06:32,078 --> 00:06:33,830
She's walking to the bar.

145
00:06:34,763 --> 00:06:36,679
- Her? Really?
- Yeah.

146
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:39,740
No, you're right.
Ambition is the enemy of success.

147
00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:41,457
Okay. Hit it.

148
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,820
What's the matter, four eyes,
you got astigmatism or something?

149
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:49,752
I'm sorry,
I was trying to playfully disarm you,

150
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,232
but I just got out of
a long relationship.

151
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,472
I have no idea what I'm doing.

152
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:55,323
I'm Marshall.

153
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:57,601
Hi, Marshall. Amy.

154
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:59,491
Don't worry. I've been there.

155
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:00,971
Hold on.

156
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,152
Nice recovery.
I think it's working.

157
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,931
Um, Amy.
This is my friend, Barney.

158
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:07,812
Barney, this is Amy.

159
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,690
Hi, Barney. Nice to meet you.

160
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,142
Hi.

161
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,490
Amy, do you like... magic?

162
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:18,410
- I hate you.
- I am so sorry.

163
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:21,563
It's a sickness.
I'm the real victim here.

164
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:22,772
Twice.

165
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:26,550
Twice in a row, you took my candy.
That was my candy.

166
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:29,690
- I know, but tonight...
- No. Forget it.

167
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,181
You're such a jackass.

168
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:36,993
I thought you were
gonna call me a jerk.

169
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:40,570
All right, I'm sorry.
I will make it up to you.

170
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:43,521
Tonight, we'll go to a
college bar near NYU--

171
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:45,440
The Scorpion and the Toad.

172
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:48,771
I figure in a younger crowd you'll
seem more mature, more worldly

173
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:52,290
and, as a third-year
law student, more smarter.

174
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:58,721
Okay, but no magic.

175
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:03,010
How did you do that?

176
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:05,163
I'm taking a leak, dumb ass.

177
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:10,232
The next day, Robin and I went
apartment-hunting with aunt Lily.

178
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:12,913
But I need the freedom to
really chase my passion,

179
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,170
which was painting,
but now I think it's music

180
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:17,083
or spoken word-- maybe both.

181
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,251
God! Isn't life amazing?

182
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,951
It is so great to see you, Ted.

183
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:24,930
I'm going to get the
key from the lockbox.

184
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,711
What?

185
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,493
She's miserable. She's realized
she's made a huge mistake.

186
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:33,902
Her and Marshall will be back
together in a week. I love it!

187
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,092
Um, no.
You just want Lily to be miserable.

188
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:37,382
The truth is, she's happy.

189
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:39,422
Trust me.
I've known Lily for nine years.

190
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:40,681
Trust me. I'm a girl.

191
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,551
Yeah, but you're Canadian.

192
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:44,871
- Why do you always have to bring that up?
- You're our weird neighbors to the north.

193
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:49,011
- You bring it up every time.
- Five bucks says she still wants Marshall.

194
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:50,301
You're on.

195
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:51,820
Five American bucks.

196
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:53,480
Damn it.

197
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:55,851
Okay, so how do we get
the truth out of her.

198
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,770
Tequila. It's her weakness.

199
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,383
Three shots, she'll tell you
the truth about anything.

200
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:03,623
I hope this is my new home.

201
00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:09,111
Yeah, I'm going to take
that first apartment.

202
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:12,291
Marshall Eriksen, suit up!

203
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:13,052
No way.

204
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:14,722
Yeah, you're good in that.

205
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:16,823
- Let's go.
- Wait.

206
00:09:16,837 --> 00:09:18,630
Empty your pockets.

207
00:09:19,556 --> 00:09:20,870
Come on.

208
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,342
- Come on, let's...
- Sleeves.

209
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:31,382
- There is nothing in my...
- Oh, is that right?

210
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:40,081
Let's go.

211
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:44,673
- Behind my ear.
- There is nothing behind your...

212
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:52,892
Yeah, I'm in pre-law.
The workload's killing me, though.

213
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:56,292
Oh, tell me about it.
I'm third year at Columbia Law, so...

214
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:59,593
if the workload does kill you,
I can probably get a conviction.

215
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,052
Yeah.

216
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:04,051
You must be majoring
in chemistry,

217
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:07,150
'cause what I'm picking
up between us is, uh...

218
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:10,433
College lesbian phase.

219
00:10:13,977 --> 00:10:17,951
Listen, I got to go,
but it'd be great to see you again.

220
00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:20,273
Yes, it would.

221
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:22,592
It really would.

222
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:25,762
Well, maybe I'll see
you here sometime.

223
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:28,632
Probably not.
I'm never here, so...

224
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:30,770
You know,
I do have a phone number.

225
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:32,392
Great.

226
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:34,512
Nice.

227
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:36,960
- Hi, I'm Barney.
- Oh, no.

228
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:40,752
Do you... mind giving my friend
your phone number?

229
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,442
Sure.

230
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,763
Whoo!

231
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,592
I did it!
I got a girl's phone number.

232
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:51,040
Oh, and her handwriting
is so cute, look.

233
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:52,673
Oh, I'm gonna take her
out for Chinesr food

234
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,192
and then maybe we'll
walk through the park.

235
00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:56,511
It'll be so... what?

236
00:10:56,748 --> 00:10:59,722
Sorry, buddy,
I'm taking this one, too.

237
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:06,042
I'll kill you!

238
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:08,511
And then, I discovered this area,
North Beach.

239
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:10,302
Best beach ever!

240
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:13,651
Oh, I've been blabbering
on about my summer.

241
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:15,373
How are you guys doing?

242
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:17,091
And hey, how's Marshall?

243
00:11:17,105 --> 00:11:18,991
- Give me the card!
- I'm not giving you any card.

244
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:20,441
- I swear...!
- You are not getting...!

245
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:21,722
Terrific.

246
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:24,632
That is so good to hear.
Oh, hold on.

247
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:27,361
This could be about
the apartment.

248
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,950
Okay, we're way
past truth-telling-Lilly

249
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:32,270
and about to
hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998-Lilly

250
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:34,211
and I'm not cleaning
that up again.

251
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:37,332
So, congratulations, you win.

252
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:39,371
She's happy.

253
00:11:39,387 --> 00:11:41,161
I didn't get it.

254
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,683
That first apartment, I...

255
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:45,813
I waited too long and...

256
00:11:45,827 --> 00:11:48,282
somebody else got it.

257
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,512
Interesting.

258
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:55,602
Wow, Lily, you, uh...

259
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:58,553
seem to be having a pretty strong
reaction on losing an apartment.

260
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:01,592
I wonder if it's because it reminds
you of something else you lost

261
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:03,873
because you couldn't commit.

262
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:06,701
No, Lily,
you're crying over the crown molding

263
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:09,962
and the real hardwood floors.
There's no deeper meaning.

264
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:12,953
Right, Lily?
Just quit crying and tell him.

265
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:18,952
The apartment is a
metaphor for Marshall.

266
00:12:22,426 --> 00:12:23,971
- Stop it!
- You don't want to see...

267
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:25,490
- ..what I'm like when I'm angry.
- It's my card!

268
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:27,041
Stop! Hold on!

269
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:28,772
If we can't settle
this like gentlemen,

270
00:12:28,786 --> 00:12:29,923
then no one gets the number.

271
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:32,761
- No! Stop the cab.
- Wha...?

272
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:37,121
No, wait. Come on. Marshall!

273
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:39,381
81st and First, please.

274
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:45,110
Ah, she does have
cute handwriting.

275
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:47,563
The thing about a hangover

276
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:50,012
is that everyone has
their own special remedy.

277
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,250
Morning, guys.
What can I get you?

278
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:52,511
Shh!

279
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:55,572
Bring me the dirtiest,
greasiest tuna melt you got.

280
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:57,272
And a milkshake.

281
00:12:57,285 --> 00:12:58,892
For you, sir?

282
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:01,183
Gravy.

283
00:13:02,307 --> 00:13:04,733
You want that
gravy on something?

284
00:13:04,747 --> 00:13:06,511
Surprise me.

285
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:10,553
I'd take you with gravy if my
boyfriend wasn't sitting right here.

286
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:13,020
Just kidding. I'm good.

287
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:16,503
What are you so chirpy about?

288
00:13:16,516 --> 00:13:18,571
She's still drunk
from last night.

289
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:20,441
I don't think so.

290
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:22,641
Whoo!

291
00:13:24,657 --> 00:13:27,063
Look, if you want
Marshall back so bad,

292
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:29,533
how come it took you two
days to even ask about him?

293
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:33,223
I was dying to ask.
I was just trying to play it cool.

294
00:13:33,236 --> 00:13:34,543
But really...

295
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:36,350
But it's good, I mean,
work is great...

296
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,352
Come on, say something about Marshall.
Where's Marshall?

297
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:40,043
How's Marshall?
What's Marshall doing right now?

298
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,482
Shut up and talk about Marshall.
Shut up and talk about Marshall.

299
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:44,821
Shut up and talk about Marshall.
Marshall, Marshall,

300
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:47,291
Marshall, Marshall...
I've got to ask!

301
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:49,491
And hey, how's Marshall?

302
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:51,351
It was such an awful summer.

303
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:53,870
I just wanted to get
back here and see him.

304
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:56,043
But I thought your
summer was great.

305
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:58,070
Not exactly.

306
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,471
Oh, my God.

307
00:14:00,517 --> 00:14:03,172
This is you best work?

308
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:08,160
In all my years teaching,
I've never seen anything so needless.

309
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:11,950
To say this is... art...

310
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:15,573
I can't teach you anything.

311
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:20,810
So all those interesting
people you met on the bus?

312
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,451
Yeah, um...

313
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:24,462
Hi. I'm Mike.

314
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:28,270
I'm a Buddhist monk slash
adventure travel writer.

315
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:33,012
I'm Paula.
I sing in a punk band for children.

316
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:39,340
Hey, I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon.
You are stunning, by the way.

317
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:43,002
I never got in touch because
I was too embarrassed.

318
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,711
I screwed everything up.

319
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:47,790
I have no job,
no place to live.

320
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:50,842
I lost the love of my life.

321
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:54,333
I know I have no right
to ask this, but...

322
00:14:54,345 --> 00:14:56,813
do you think Marshall
would take me back?

323
00:14:56,825 --> 00:14:58,173
In a heartbeat.

324
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:01,852
If you called him up, yeah,
he'd take you back with open arms.

325
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,941
Wow. So maybe
I should call him.

326
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:06,411
Maybe.

327
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:09,453
No! This is... Ow!

328
00:15:10,597 --> 00:15:11,790
Hold on.

329
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:14,212
Look, if you're going
to go back to him,

330
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:15,361
I don't want to hear
the word "maybe."

331
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,500
"Maybe" cannot be
in your vocabulary.

332
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,311
This breakup almost killed him.

333
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:21,673
And he cannot go
through it again.

334
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:26,702
So, unless you're absolutely certain,
stay the hell away from him.

335
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:32,853
This guy likes pennies.

336
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:36,673
Hi, Marshall.

337
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,842
No, go away.
I don't want to talk to you.

338
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:44,062
Okay, I know what I did a couple
nights back is in a moral gray area.

339
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:47,490
But the great news is,
she loved you.

340
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:49,723
If things had gone your way--
you'd gone out a couple times,

341
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:52,033
I think she definitely
would have had sex with you.

342
00:15:52,046 --> 00:15:54,591
There's no "would" in sex.

343
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:59,792
You're right, I totally...
I'm just no good at this, Barney.

344
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:02,931
I'm good at being in a couple,
I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend.

345
00:16:02,946 --> 00:16:05,013
Being single-- forget it.

346
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:06,573
Come on, you can't give up now.

347
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:08,841
What if I told you that
you could relive that night

348
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:11,661
with the exact same conversations,
the exact same jokes

349
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:15,060
only this time,
you get her and I don't.

350
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,233
That's not possible.

351
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:17,691
Oh, but it is.

352
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,351
She has...

353
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:20,972
wait for it...

354
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:22,613
here it comes...

355
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:24,221
almost there...

356
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:26,192
an identical twin.

357
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:27,763
Yes!

358
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:29,933
A twin isn't the same person.

359
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:32,250
Of course it is.
What do you think identical means?

360
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:35,321
"Ident"-- same, "ical"-- person.
Same person.

361
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:38,092
Hey, we could double date.

362
00:16:39,316 --> 00:16:40,651
Fine.

363
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,811
But you have to promise me,
you're not going to steal my new twin,

364
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:48,192
and leave me with your old,
used-up twin.

365
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:49,900
Used-up?

366
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:52,703
They're a human being,
Marshall.

367
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:56,603
So Uncle Marshall and
Uncle Barney went out

368
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,970
on a double date
with the twins.

369
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,070
How you doing?

370
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,871
Great. Amazing.
This is so much fun.

371
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:05,603
And I think me and the
girl are really clicking.

372
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:07,292
You are, you definitely are.

373
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:09,450
Listen, you're going
to have to leave now.

374
00:17:09,468 --> 00:17:11,291
I just talked with the twins,
and get this,

375
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:14,290
I'm going home
with both of them.

376
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:17,510
Yeah. That's happening.

377
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:20,682
It is impossible that you're
doing this to me again.

378
00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:23,142
But they're twins.

379
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:25,413
You-- you said to me
that being single

380
00:17:25,426 --> 00:17:27,121
would be like being
in a candy store.

381
00:17:27,135 --> 00:17:28,990
Well, it's not,
it's not like a candy store.

382
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,102
It's a lawless,
postapocalyptic wasteland.

383
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,082
- I may be your best friend...
- Actually Ted's my best friend.

384
00:17:34,115 --> 00:17:37,830
But in this world,
it's every hombre for himself.

385
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,872
That's what being single is.

386
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:41,841
And after nine
years in captivity,

387
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:43,943
that is the single greatest lesson
I can teach you

388
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:46,053
about surviving in the wild.

389
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,862
Now, if you'll excuse me...

390
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:49,951
I have two unique breasts

391
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:52,893
and two duplicates
waiting for me.

392
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,803
Oh, bad news--
Marshall got food poisoning.

393
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:00,910
- What?
- Oh, no.

394
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:03,053
That's too bad.
I really liked him.

395
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:07,360
Yeah. Well, I guess
we're just a threesome tonight.

396
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:20,702
Lily, what are you doing here?

397
00:18:20,717 --> 00:18:23,982
Oh, I was just walking by.
I wasn't...

398
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:26,800
Oh, you mean New York?
My program ended.

399
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,662
It was just great.
Just lots of fun...

400
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:32,821
It was awful.
It was the worst mistake I ever made.

401
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:36,223
I'm so sorry,
Marshall, and... hello.

402
00:18:38,506 --> 00:18:41,483
Lily, this was the
worst summer of my life.

403
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,210
I know.
It was the worst summer of my life.

404
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:47,240
It was the hardest thing that
I've ever had to go through.

405
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,130
Can we please get
back together?

406
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:55,390
All that crap you
said to me about,

407
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:58,813
"we need to figure out
who we are outside of us,

408
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:01,763
and we need to learn to
do things on our own,"

409
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:04,851
it broke my heart.

410
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:08,870
Three months ago,
you broke my heart.

411
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:13,823
Can we please get
back together?

412
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:17,153
Lily, you were right.

413
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:21,090
All that crap was right.

414
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:24,491
So, no.

415
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:27,172
No, we can't get back together.

416
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:28,920
We shouldn't.

417
00:19:29,116 --> 00:19:31,263
At least, not right now.

418
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,300
Wow.

419
00:19:35,598 --> 00:19:37,280
Okay.

420
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:40,300
Yeah.

421
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:43,412
Well...

422
00:19:45,406 --> 00:19:48,002
Will we still see each other?

423
00:19:48,476 --> 00:19:50,570
Yeah, yeah.

424
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:52,271
I think so.

425
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:55,520
I don't know.

426
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:59,000
This is all really new to me.

427
00:20:00,418 --> 00:20:03,220
I just got out of a
long relationship.

428
00:20:07,487 --> 00:20:09,130
I like your hair.

429
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:11,190
Thanks.

430
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:15,130
I figured new city,
a different color...

431
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:17,073
♪ ...Wide open road ♪

432
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:20,450
♪ It was love to us ♪

433
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:23,552
♪ It was all that we had... ♪

434
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:27,702
And the pizza there,
worst pizza ever.

435
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:31,013
I'm so glad to be
back in New York.

436
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:36,150
Listen, if there's anything
I can do to even begin

437
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,733
to make things up to you...

438
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:43,843
Actually there may be something
that you can do for me,

439
00:20:43,855 --> 00:20:47,340
but you can never
ever ask me why.

440
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:50,561
So then I was promoted to
assistant ménage-er...

441
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:53,631
Manager-- why do
I keep doing that?

442
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:58,710
- Lily?
- You gave me chlamydia, you jerk.

443
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:06,482
So where was I?
Ah, yes, assistant ménage-er...

444
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:09,541
I did it again.
I can't believe it.

445
00:21:10,427 --> 00:21:15,620
You gave my twin sister chlamydia.
You slime!

446
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:20,220
Wha... wait, I know magic.

447
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:26,211
Well played, Eriksen.

448
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:28,741
Well played.
