1
00:00:00,022 --> 00:00:03,166
Kids, the key to a good
relationship is communication.

2
00:00:03,283 --> 00:00:05,532
- You need to talk.
- How about Mimi's?

3
00:00:05,562 --> 00:00:07,075
Nah, I don't really
feel like Mimi's.

4
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:09,208
Well, I'm hungry.
Let's just pick a place and go.

5
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:11,569
Oh, you know where we
should go? Cynthia's.

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,304
You love that place--
remember what a great time we had

7
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:14,330
the last time we were there?

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,874
- We did?
- Yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:18,635
We had that crazy waiter who kept going,
"You two should get married!

10
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:20,240
You two should get married!"

11
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:22,833
It's also important to
know when to stop talking.

12
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,960
Come on. Then we stepped outside.
It was raining.

13
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,851
It was so romantic?

14
00:00:27,883 --> 00:00:29,730
How can you not remember this?

15
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:31,892
Because it wasn't me.

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,067
Oh, right!

17
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:36,661
It was...

18
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:38,534
my sister.

19
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,462
You see,
by the time you've hit your late 20s,

20
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:42,892
you've dated a few people,

21
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:45,477
but when you're in a relationship,
it's common courtesy to pretend

22
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,449
that you haven't.

23
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:49,113
Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on.

24
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,819
Remember when we
went to see it?

25
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:52,600
We sat in the back row.

26
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,057
I've never seen Van Helsing.

27
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:57,298
That's right.
I saw it with my sister.

28
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,576
My boss just got
back from Maui.

29
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:02,028
He said it was really romantic.

30
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:03,653
Oh, it's so romantic.

31
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:05,446
When were you in Maui?

32
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:09,805
- I... went... with my sister.
- With my sister.

33
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:11,546
Why do you always say that?

34
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,475
Look, we're not 16.
We've both dated other people.

35
00:01:15,507 --> 00:01:17,628
It's silly to try to
act like we didn't.

36
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:18,760
You're right.

37
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:20,174
We should just be honest.

38
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:21,305
Totally.

39
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,139
See that girl over there?

40
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:26,695
Three years ago,
I totally made out with her.

41
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,670
I don't want to hear that.

42
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:31,213
- What? You said...
- God, that is so insensitive.

43
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:33,085
- Remember honesty...?
- You're a jerk!

44
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:35,349
Well, you're...

45
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,162
confusing.

46
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,100
Sync by vNaru

47
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:54,053
Okay, so you have to
have sex with one.

48
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:57,868
Either classic mermaid;
bottom half fish, top half human,

49
00:01:57,904 --> 00:02:01,948
or inverted mermaid,
top half fish, bottom half human.

50
00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:03,027
Go!

51
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:05,061
I don't know. Is she fat?

52
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:07,849
Yeah, but it's a fish,
so it's the good kind of fat.

53
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:10,113
Hot off the presses!

54
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:11,675
I-I don't take flyers.

55
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:13,618
You took one two seconds
before you walked in here.

56
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:15,463
That's different.
It was for a strip club.

57
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:16,432
Two bucks off wings.

58
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:18,117
How much is your flyer
going to save me on wings?

59
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,459
Fine. It's a flyer
from my play.

60
00:02:20,494 --> 00:02:23,237
Oh, Lily, I'd love to,
but we're not in college

61
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,797
and I'm not trying
to sleep with you.

62
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,502
- So anyway, this mermaid...
- Hey, Lily's friend asked her

63
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,038
to be in this play,
and it's gonna be really good.

64
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:33,596
Lily, I love you,
but we're too old for this.

65
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,458
Asking someone to
come see your play

66
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:38,073
is like asking someone
for a ride to the airport

67
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,868
or to crash on your couch
or to help you move.

68
00:02:40,902 --> 00:02:42,521
Call a cab, book a room,

69
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:44,617
hire some movers
and repeat after me:

70
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:47,990
Friends don't let friends
come see their crappy play.

71
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:52,722
Okay, first of all,
I've thought about it and top half fish.

72
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:55,715
Second of all, we need you guys
to decide something for us.

73
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:57,119
Yes, you should break up.

74
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:00,927
So, earlier tonight...

75
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:05,052
Mm, we should get
down to the bar.

76
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:06,858
I know we should,

77
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:10,473
but you just look so sexy
in my red sweatshirt.

78
00:03:12,954 --> 00:03:15,802
Oh, God,
why is this part of the story?

79
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:17,076
We're getting to it.

80
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:20,543
Damn, my face is so dry.
Is there any moisturizer around here?

81
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,124
Yeah, there's some
in the bathroom.

82
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:23,757
Got to moisturize!

83
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:26,034
Got to keep that
pretty face moist.

84
00:03:26,387 --> 00:03:29,037
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

85
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:31,723
- What's wrong with her?
- She hates that word.

86
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:35,028
- What word, "moist"?
- No! Seriously, stop!

87
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:38,776
So, anyway, Ted goes into the
bathroom to get the moist...

88
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:40,369
face lotion...

89
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:42,193
Wow, this is great stuff.

90
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:44,609
Now I know the secret to
your great complexion.

91
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:46,199
What are you talking about?
It's yours.

92
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:47,412
No, it's not.

93
00:03:47,448 --> 00:03:49,868
Oh, well...
then I guess it's Lily's.

94
00:03:49,903 --> 00:03:51,208
No, it's not.

95
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:54,083
Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?

96
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:55,548
Um, my sister's.

97
00:03:56,084 --> 00:03:58,953
So, in other words,
some girl you went out with.

98
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:01,901
Um... I love you.

99
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:06,356
Disgusting. You let me put on the
same moisturizer as one of your exes?

100
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:09,322
It was probably Carla's.
Her face was a train wreck.

101
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,037
I'm don't think Ted was
dating her for her face.

102
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:14,252
Thank you, Marshall.

103
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:15,767
Thank you so much.

104
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:18,348
Why is that still
in your apartment?

105
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,158
I don't know.
I just never threw it out.

106
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:22,785
Well, why not? Do you still
have feelings for this girl?

107
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:25,179
Yeah. I'm madly
in love with her,

108
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:26,743
and the only way
I can deal with it

109
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:28,994
is by holding onto a
three-dollar tube of lotion.

110
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,211
Not three dollars! Try 14.

111
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:34,735
Why is this such a big deal?

112
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:37,792
Because I don't want to use
some whore's moisturizer!

113
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:39,788
Whoa, she wasn't a whore.

114
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,950
Well, she's leaving expensive
lotions all over town.

115
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:44,595
It sounds like a whore to me.

116
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,362
What else do you have from old
girlfriends just lying around?

117
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:48,962
Nothing. That's it.

118
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:51,468
Well, except for
the phone booth.

119
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:54,041
And the lamp by the desk...

120
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,168
and the...

121
00:04:57,946 --> 00:04:59,243
No.

122
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,979
No! No! Oh, Ted!

123
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:06,267
Ah, the age-old question:

124
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,861
after you break up with someone,
what do you do with the stuff?

125
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:11,226
Question? Ain't no
question, girl.

126
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:12,947
Obviously, he's got
to get rid of it.

127
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:16,104
Which is obviously crazy and obviously,
I'm not gonna do it.

128
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,049
So we agreed that we
would let you guys decide.

129
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,133
Yeah, like we did with
Marshall's pants.

130
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:26,573
Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v.
The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.

131
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:31,331
Nice, right?

132
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,826
I'm gonna have to say no.

133
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:36,821
I don't want some 16-year-old
girl falling in love with you

134
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:38,626
and then shooting
Lily in the face.

135
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,657
Yes!

136
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:42,261
I vote they can stay.

137
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:45,658
"Check out the jackass in the
parachute pants" is a good icebreaker.

138
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:47,410
Ted.

139
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:50,237
Ted? Ted?

140
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,410
Sorry, buddy,
it's a "no" for me, too.

141
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:55,027
Oh, and by the way,
Bel Biv Devoe called.

142
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:57,208
Even they don't want
those pants back.

143
00:05:57,342 --> 00:05:59,562
They were insanely comfortable!

144
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:01,967
They were like pajamas
you could wear outside.

145
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:03,697
Marshall, it's over.

146
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,530
We even gave you an appeal and they
didn't look any better with combat boots.

147
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:11,425
All right, well, let's hear the
arguments. Ted, you go first.

148
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:15,355
Okay. The fact that I still have things
from ex-girlfriends is no big deal.

149
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:17,429
I mean,
when I see the phone booth on the piano,

150
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:19,130
I don't think of
Jeannie Radford,

151
00:06:19,164 --> 00:06:21,705
I think of the good times I
had backpacking through Europe.

152
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,873
And when I see the lamp,
I don't think of Allison Moses.

153
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:27,115
I remember when I was broke,
just out of college,

154
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:28,898
and I really needed a lamp.

155
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:32,135
And when I see that throw pillow,
I don't think of Lauren Stein.

156
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:35,151
I think of that weird orange-brown
stain and how it got there.

157
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,014
Creamsicle and turkey gravy,

158
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:38,517
not at the same time.

159
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,640
Well, that's adorable,

160
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:44,428
but from now on, when I walk into the
apartment, here is what I will see.

161
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:50,058
I'm Ted's college girlfriend.
He made me 12 mix tapes.

162
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,991
How many has he made you?

163
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,988
He calls you "sweetie pie"?

164
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:58,134
He called me "sweetie pie."

165
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:04,045
I'm stupid,
but my rack is bigger than yours.

166
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,790
Really? You can't
look at a pillow

167
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,865
without seeing my ex-girlfriend--
a pillow!

168
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:13,260
Yes, Ted, the fact that you still
have that pillow is creepy and gross.

169
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:16,055
- You're creepy and gross.
- Your mom's creepy and gross.

170
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:17,880
Order! Order!

171
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,916
I got to side with Robin.

172
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:24,211
She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff
upsets her, you got to get rid of it.

173
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:26,045
I've got to side with Ted.

174
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,148
Just 'cause you still have
something an ex-girlfriend gave you

175
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:29,881
doesn't mean you're
holding onto her.

176
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,315
All right, Barney.

177
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,359
It all comes down to you.

178
00:07:34,506 --> 00:07:36,663
- I side with Robin.
- What?

179
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,438
Ted, your place
is too cluttered.

180
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:40,721
It's like you're living
in a Bennigan's.

181
00:07:41,188 --> 00:07:42,776
Or a Danby's.

182
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,595
What, they don't have
Danby's in the US?

183
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:48,475
Really?

184
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:51,704
Well, then were do you get
Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?

185
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,336
Just stop, sweetie.

186
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:57,214
So I had no choice.

187
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:59,927
I packed up everything I had
gotten from ex-girlfriends.

188
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:01,352
It was painful,

189
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:04,678
but not as painful as what I
had to endure later that night.

190
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:08,164
New York is famous
for its theater,

191
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,828
but there's many
different levels.

192
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:11,277
There's Broadway,

193
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:12,953
off-Broadway,

194
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:14,797
off-off-Broadway,

195
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:17,060
homeless people
screaming in the park,

196
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:20,224
and then below that,
the play Aunt Lily was in.

197
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:22,749
Eight flights, of stairs.

198
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:25,795
Who puts a theater up
eight flights of stairs?

199
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:27,330
What kind of building is this?

200
00:08:27,364 --> 00:08:30,556
From the smell of it,
I'm guessing a urine factory.

201
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,577
Where do you guys want to sit?

202
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,976
I know where I
don't want to sit.

203
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:37,660
Guys, four together!

204
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,719
I brought a bag in case
anyone needs to puke.

205
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,262
Come on.
It's not gonna be that bad.

206
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:46,927
No? Okay.

207
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:06,422
I... am... Rage!

208
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:12,561
I... am Greed.

209
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:20,346
I am Rage... Envy!

210
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:22,541
I am outta here.

211
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:24,757
No, you're not.
You have to stay.

212
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:31,528
This is the face
of Consumerism!

213
00:09:31,563 --> 00:09:34,092
Oh, my God.
Ted's part of the play.

214
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:45,145
Hello, Greed, Rage...

215
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,236
Envy...

216
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:52,315
and Consumerism.

217
00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:59,480
I... am your father...

218
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:02,004
America!

219
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:20,520
Oh, baby, that was wonderful!

220
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:22,895
Totally, I had no idea
Greed was the killer.

221
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,688
And when it became a
play within a play,

222
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:27,092
I was, like,
"Now we are really cookin'!"

223
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:30,105
Wow, Lily, that sucked!

224
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:31,962
Barney!

225
00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:33,605
What? It was terrible.

226
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:35,956
I mean, come on.
You guys agree, right?

227
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:39,635
Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest
'cause, you know, we're friends.

228
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:42,390
No, friends make each
other feel good.

229
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:44,676
They build each other
up and support them.

230
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,018
That's what being a
good friend is about.

231
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:49,334
Yeah, if you're a Smurf.

232
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,128
You know if you did a play,
I would sit through the whole thing

233
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:54,493
and I would compliment
you on it afterwards.

234
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,853
Oh, really? You would?

235
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,935
Yes.

236
00:10:56,992 --> 00:11:00,404
Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.

237
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:04,351
We'll be starting our
Q&A with the director--

238
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:05,684
yours truly--

239
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,196
in five minutes right here.

240
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,250
Can you believe Barney said
that about Lily's play?

241
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:17,235
I know.
He can be really insensitive.

242
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:19,199
It was pretty bad, though.

243
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:20,941
Oh, my God, it was so bad.

244
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,757
Oh, my God, you've been robbed!

245
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:29,859
Nope.

246
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,411
All that stuff was
from old girlfriends?

247
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,787
Don't you buy anything
for yourself?

248
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,230
What can I say?

249
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:43,903
Papa gets swag.

250
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:48,102
And that should've been the end of it.
But the next day...

251
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:50,515
You know, at first I was really bummed
about getting rid of all my stuff.

252
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:53,113
But seeing how happy it makes you--
totally worth it.

253
00:11:53,148 --> 00:11:55,613
Mm, that's kind of how I feel when
I begrudgingly have sex with you

254
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:56,839
when I'm really tired.

255
00:11:56,874 --> 00:11:59,652
Exactly. Sometimes you
gotta take one for the team.

256
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,530
Well, sit. Sit, yeah.

257
00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:05,905
So you never keep anything
your ex-boyfriends gave you?

258
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,005
Nope.

259
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,918
Well, except for my dogs.

260
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:26,577
So I had to get rid of everything
from my past relationships

261
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:29,132
because you don't keep things
from your past relationships

262
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:32,441
except, uh, where are your five
dogs from? Oh, that's right:

263
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:34,071
your past relationships.

264
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:35,405
What's your point, Ted?

265
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:38,008
Well, you know how you said
you come over to my apartment,

266
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:40,262
and all you can see
are my ex-girlfriends?

267
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,832
What, so when you look at my dogs,
all you see is my ex-boyfriends?

268
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:50,594
I do now.

269
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,349
That's ridiculous.

270
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:55,953
I thought you said you got rid of
everything your ex-boyfriends gave you.

271
00:12:55,989 --> 00:12:57,576
Well, yeah, but not my dogs.

272
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,419
You said everything.

273
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:00,032
But not living things.

274
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:02,996
Well, tell that to the rare
Bolivian cactus I threw away.

275
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:05,220
Things with a
heartbeat can stay.

276
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,820
Enjoying this?

277
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,891
Pickles, go get your ball.

278
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,534
Go get your ball.

279
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:20,949
Just admit it.
It was a little hypocritical of you

280
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:22,532
to make me get rid
of all my stuff.

281
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,838
Well, what do you want me to do, Ted?
Get rid of my dogs?

282
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:29,896
Guess what position
we did it in.

283
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,732
Yes. Yes,
I want you to get rid of your dogs.

284
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,523
Um, no.

285
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:42,640
Really? Well,
I say we take it to the group,

286
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:45,385
but I don't like your chances.

287
00:13:45,511 --> 00:13:48,332
She's not getting
rid of the dogs.

288
00:13:48,364 --> 00:13:50,154
What's the matter with you?

289
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:52,397
- Even I wouldn't do that.
- Yes!

290
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:55,843
You can ask somebody to get rid of their
iguana after it poops in your hair,

291
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,667
but not their dog.

292
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,479
I miss Jebediah.

293
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:01,504
Oh, I almost forgot.

294
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,461
Flyers for my new play.

295
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:05,964
Very funny.

296
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:07,105
Oh, it's not a joke.

297
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,469
It's my one-man show
premiering tomorrow night.

298
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:12,253
And even though it's terrible
and excruciatingly long,

299
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:14,948
I expect you all to be there
since we're such good friends.

300
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,132
Oh, we'll be there.

301
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,274
Unless, of course, you just want
to admit that you were wrong...

302
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,820
- Never.
- Good.

303
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,364
Okay, I gotta go rehearse.

304
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:25,160
Oh, I almost forgot.
Bring a poncho;

305
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:26,743
the first three rows get wet.

306
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:44,135
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
where the dogs came from.

307
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:46,870
I'm sorry I asked you
to get rid of them.

308
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:48,413
That was ridiculous.

309
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,378
So we're-we're okay?

310
00:14:51,421 --> 00:14:52,651
Yeah, we're great.

311
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:54,835
And I thought we were,

312
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,008
but just as it did in the
seventh act of Aunt Lily's play,

313
00:14:58,046 --> 00:15:00,395
Jealousy reared its ugly head.

314
00:15:08,322 --> 00:15:11,675
Oh, yeah, that's the spot.

315
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,175
Dude, I gotta pee.

316
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:31,934
I gotta go.

317
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:40,246
Oh, he's really having trouble
dealing with this, huh?

318
00:15:40,283 --> 00:15:41,761
Yeah, he really is.

319
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:44,978
It's got me thinking,
maybe I should get rid of my dogs.

320
00:15:45,283 --> 00:15:47,450
Might be time to send
them to the farm.

321
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:50,167
- You're gonna kill your dogs?!
- No! No, no, no,

322
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:51,721
there really is a farm.

323
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:53,532
My aunt has a farm upstate.

324
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:55,007
Oh, thank God.

325
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,421
Aw, you know,
if I were five dogs,

326
00:15:57,453 --> 00:16:01,077
I'd rather live on a farm than
in an apartment in Brooklyn.

327
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,922
Yeah. I could visit
them on weekends.

328
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:07,768
My aunt is awfully lonely up there.
It's just her and her lover, Betty.

329
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:10,756
Oh, that's perfect.
They love dogs.

330
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:12,908
"They"? What do
you mean by "they"?

331
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,515
Uh... uh.... uh...
People upstate.

332
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,135
Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!

333
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,465
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?

334
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:22,755
I mean,
you know that this is gonna be...

335
00:16:22,794 --> 00:16:25,581
I know, but I'm gonna sit
through the whole thing,

336
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:28,058
and I'm gonna say something
nice about it afterwards.

337
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:29,008
You know why?

338
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:30,820
Because that's what friends do.

339
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:47,845
Moist.

340
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:50,781
Moist.

341
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:52,584
Moist.

342
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:54,886
Moist.

343
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,011
That was the first 40
minutes of Barney's show.

344
00:16:57,045 --> 00:16:58,082
Moist.

345
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:02,429
And then we endured
about 20 minutes of this.

346
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,014
I have to go refill.

347
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:17,899
I'll be back in a moment.

348
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:19,191
Play's not over.

349
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:25,234
I never get picked for
audience participation.

350
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:28,608
And then it just got weird.

351
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:34,420
Feelings.

352
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:36,664
Inside.

353
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:39,861
Oh, no!

354
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,420
And when that didn't work...

355
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:12,240
Okay! Stop!

356
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:14,042
You win. Fine.

357
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,692
Barney, I'm sorry I made
you come to my show.

358
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:18,821
Thank you, Lily.

359
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:21,008
Is there anything you'd
like to say about my show?

360
00:18:21,043 --> 00:18:21,957
No.

361
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:25,356
No, I have nothing nice
to say about your show.

362
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:26,827
You were right, Barney.

363
00:18:26,862 --> 00:18:28,199
Let's go to the bar.

364
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:30,623
Yes! I win!

365
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:32,358
I love winning!

366
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:35,806
Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily.

367
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:37,919
I was just getting
warmed up, man!

368
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:41,127
If you had any idea what was
coming up in act two... oh!

369
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,684
Well, I imagine it was pretty awful,
so let's go.

370
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:48,049
Pretty awful? Pretty awful?!
It was a masterpiece of awful.

371
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,574
It's genius how bad it is.
I kind of wish you guys could see it.

372
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,277
Yeah, well, anyway.

373
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:55,715
Act two is where I
really hit my stride.

374
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:59,499
Spoiler alert:
the robot falls in love.

375
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,521
How about this, Barney?
How about we stay

376
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:07,586
and-and watch the
rest of your show?

377
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:12,386
It's your funeral.

378
00:19:13,713 --> 00:19:15,709
Five, six, one, two.

379
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:21,942
So we stayed and let Barney torture
us for another hour and a half,

380
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:24,937
'cause that's what
friends do, apparently.

381
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:28,035
Hey.

382
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:30,158
Where've you been?
I called you earlier.

383
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:32,803
I gave my dogs away to my aunt.

384
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,976
You what?

385
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:37,843
Yeah. Just for a few months
as a test run, but...

386
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,217
I think it's for the best.

387
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:41,989
Wow.

388
00:19:42,897 --> 00:19:44,925
Oh, man.

389
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:48,602
Can we go inside?

390
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:51,015
Uh, no.
Uh, let's go to the bar.

391
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:52,680
Why? What's going on inside?

392
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:55,014
- Um, the floors are gone.
- What?

393
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:57,567
Yeah. I-I sent them out to get,
um, fixed.

394
00:19:57,605 --> 00:19:59,592
This is a terrible lie.
I'm just going to bail.

395
00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:14,319
I didn't know you were
getting rid of the dogs!

396
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:16,274
You said you threw
all that stuff away!

397
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:19,368
Kids, this was the worst
fight Robin and I ever had.

398
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:21,825
It was one of those fights
that last for hours

399
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,009
and you start to get woozy and lose
track of what you're fighting about.

400
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:28,835
We fought for so long,
seasons changed outside the window.

401
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:31,713
Pages of the calendar blew off.
It was crazy.

402
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:35,339
But, ultimately, and I couldn't
tell you how for the life of me,

403
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,962
but somehow we got to here.

404
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:43,545
We're really doing this?

405
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:46,128
Yeah.

406
00:20:47,007 --> 00:20:49,165
- We're moving in together!
- We're moving in together!

407
00:20:55,261 --> 00:20:57,920
The robot found love

408
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,815
Confusing my circuitry

409
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,981
My software's been hacked

410
00:21:02,016 --> 00:21:03,644
Toaster oven

411
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:10,874
You're the one for me

412
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,140
Two, three, four.

413
00:21:22,624 --> 00:21:24,051
That's two.
