1
00:00:00,787 --> 00:00:02,432
...some weird stuff started happening.

2
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:04,358
Why does my stomach hurt?

3
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:07,423
I'm sorry, baby.
I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today.

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,306
Oh, baby, you know
we're lactose-intolerant.

5
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:11,879
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6
00:00:12,226 --> 00:00:14,879
Are you suggesting that
when one of you feels something,

7
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:18,970
- the other feels it, too?
- Oh, God, you guys are so codependent.

8
00:00:18,988 --> 00:00:21,130
- No, we're not.
- Oh, really?

9
00:00:21,584 --> 00:00:22,806
What about the other day?

10
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:26,199
- Oh, I need to get some eggs.
- Oh, I'll come with you.

11
00:00:34,814 --> 00:00:38,250
Just because we like spending time
together doesn't mean we're codependent.

12
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:39,394
Really?

13
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:42,092
Then whatever happened to your plan
of spending the last two weeks

14
00:00:42,094 --> 00:00:44,123
before your wedding sleeping apart?

15
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:48,651
Okay, we decided not
to do that because of...

16
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:49,927
Logistics.

17
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:51,896
- Wedding logistics.
- Frickin' logistics, man.

18
00:00:51,922 --> 00:00:53,281
They mess everything up.

19
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:55,645
You didn't do it
because you couldn't do it.

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,356
- Sure we could.
- Then why don't you?

21
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:58,645
You can stay with me.

22
00:01:01,158 --> 00:01:04,015
It would make our wedding
night more special.

23
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:07,156
- Okay, let's do it.
- Done.

24
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:10,040
- I'm gonna go grab a beer.
- I'll come with you.

25
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:14,545
No. I'll stay.

26
00:01:17,423 --> 00:01:19,911
Sync by vNaru

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,217
Okay, I know.
You know? I got to go.

28
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,523
Good-bye.

29
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:37,577
My mom's driving me cra....

30
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,252
God, you guys are covered in sauce.

31
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:40,672
We'll get to that.
Me first.

32
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:43,593
My mom is driving me crazy
about the wedding music.

33
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:46,669
The woman takes one cruise
to Jamaica, and suddenly, it's

34
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:49,101
"not a party without steel drums."

35
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:51,244
Doesn't everybody know
you're not supposed to stress out

36
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:53,079
a bride right before her wedding?!

37
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:56,713
Okay, sauce, go.

38
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:59,419
- Long story. I'll tell you later.
- Yeah.

39
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:01,162
It's a dirty story, isn't it?

40
00:02:01,184 --> 00:02:04,522
You guys went out to dinner,
did it in the kitchen and got caught.

41
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:07,809
Scherbatsky reeks of
someone who likes to get caught.

44
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:20,122
So you and Lily really think
you can spend two weeks apart?

45
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:21,047
You know what, Barney?

46
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:23,882
Lily and I are a lot less chees
than you make us out to be.

47
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:27,052
Marshmallow, don't forget
to pack my night-night tape.

48
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:29,963
Night-night tape?

49
00:02:30,277 --> 00:02:34,431
Did you make a tape of
you saying "night-night" to her?

50
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:37,430
- No.
- He doesn't say it. He sings it.

51
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,957
Oh, that is so sweet.

52
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:43,409
Why don't you kiss?
I love it when two chicks make out.

53
00:02:44,487 --> 00:02:45,430
Damn it.

54
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:48,153
Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.

55
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:50,370
- What's on there?
- Ooh, lots of stuff.

56
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:53,803
Kitchen Aide Artisan Series
tilt-head stand mixer...

57
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:57,128
Retail price $319.99.
What else?

58
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:02,793
Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum.

59
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:07,191
Ah, $549.99.
A little greedy, don't you think?

60
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:11,575
- Did you memorize our registry?
- No, I'm training.

61
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:14,774
- Training? For what?
- I'm glad you asked.

62
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:16,323
Ted, Robin, get in here!

63
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:20,788
You guys know how it's hard to be
friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?

64
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:23,799
Yes, it's hard to be friends with you.
Go on.

65
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:26,363
Well, this isn't going
to make it any easier.

66
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:30,822
I am going to be on...
The Price Is Right.

67
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,250
- No way!
- What?!

68
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:36,220
Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields
is going to call out my name,

69
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:40,254
- and I will come on down.
- Whoa, that is so awesome.

70
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,814
Barney, I didn't know you were
such a fan of The Price is Right.

71
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:44,465
Are you kidding?

72
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:49,211
T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably
entertaining hour of television,

73
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:52,593
it's a microcosm of
our entire economic system--

74
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:57,428
a capitalist utopia, where consumers
are rewarded for their persistence,

75
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:01,020
market acumen and intrepid spirit.

76
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:05,875
I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right,

77
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:08,994
and I see the face of America.

78
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,774
And it is divine.

79
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,992
Plus, you know,
hot chicks on sports cars.

80
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:19,951
Then Lily headed out to Robin's
for her first night away from Marshall.

81
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:25,850
- I'm ready!
- Ta-da-da-da-da...

82
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:32,595
- Wow, Lily, you look so beautiful.
- I know! I'm beautiful!

83
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:35,659
I'm a fairy princess!

84
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,880
I'm too skinny for my dress!

85
00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:42,876
Meanwhile, I was testing out
my best man toast on Marshall.

86
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:44,173
Here goes.

87
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:48,727
Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby,
Marshall's best man.

88
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:50,226
Strong opening, right?
That's fantastic.

89
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,013
When Marshall graduates
this spring, he'll be a lawyer.

90
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,261
But did you know that
Marshall has a criminal record?

91
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:59,123
That's right, on a road trip
up to Cape Cod,

92
00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:03,302
Marshall was pulled over for driving
by himself in a car pool lane.

93
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:05,263
Oh, crap.

94
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,203
Oh, crap.

95
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:10,372
Are you crazy?

96
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,562
You cannot tell that story
at my wedding.

97
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:15,196
My entire family's gonna be there.

98
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,269
My little cousins, my mom, my grandma,
my grandpa the minister.

99
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,220
That grandpa died three years ago.

100
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:24,055
His favorite grandson
is getting married, Ted.

101
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,187
I think he can take a day off from
haunting the barn to make an appearance.

102
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:29,206
Whoo!

103
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,235
Whoo-whoo!

104
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:32,375
Whoo!

105
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:34,242
Whoo-hoo!

106
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,046
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

107
00:05:40,513 --> 00:05:46,285
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

108
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:49,531
- So which one, "A" or "B"?
- What was that?

109
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:52,327
I have to decide how to run
to contestant's row when they say,

110
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:54,271
"Barney Stinson, come on down!"

111
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:57,405
Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was.
Can you do them again?

112
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:58,916
Yeah, of course.

113
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:05,884
Hey! Very funny.

114
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:09,715
Just for that, when I win all the prizes,
the only thing you guys are getting

115
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:12,177
is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.

116
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:17,738
It's $300 just to take the bust in?

117
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,678
Oh, please, you have to have
some sympathy for me.

118
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:24,205
I'm getting married next Saturday,
and I'm too skinny for my dress.

119
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,866
I lost all this weight
without even trying.

120
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,009
Hello?

121
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:32,197
- What happened?
- She called me a bitch and hung up.

122
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:36,013
Oh, I don't know what to do.
I guess I'll just have to pay the $300.

123
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:38,524
Pay the $300?
Lily, are you crazy?

124
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:41,531
This isn't a problem.
It's a license to eat.

125
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:45,768
Look, what have you always wanted to eat but
didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?

126
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:50,314
Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate soufflÃ©
with a raspberry brandy sauce

127
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:55,080
topped with caramelized bananas
and hazelnut gelato.

128
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:58,422
I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos.

129
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,191
Done!

130
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,364
Okay, think you're gonna be
happy with my new toast.

131
00:07:04,387 --> 00:07:05,757
There's nothing sexual.

132
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:09,107
It's, uh, it's just the story of an
important moment in your relationship.

133
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:10,117
I'm all ears.

134
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:13,552
Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby,
Marshall's best man.

135
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,079
- Nice.
- Right? That's great.

136
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:16,540
Back when we were all freshman

137
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:19,492
and Marshall and Lily were just a few
short weeks into their relationship...

138
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:24,247
It was 4:00 in the morning, and I'm not
gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted.

139
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:26,034
We were starving.

140
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:29,686
So I'd gone out to get us some
snacks, and when I got back...

141
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:37,029
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

142
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:41,218
I know it's soon to say it,
but I'm so glad you did.

143
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:44,822
Yeah.

144
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:50,444
So here's what you want to talk
about in front of my entire family:

145
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:53,958
drinking, having a girl in my room,
eating junk food.

146
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:57,186
Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would
be mad at you for eating junk food?

147
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,462
Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's
not important.

148
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:03,795
Also, so Lily's never heard
that story before.

149
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:05,227
How's she going to react when she finds out...

150
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:08,024
...this is the $1 space
on The Price Is Right wheel.

151
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:09,056
Ready?

152
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:19,675
Oh, wow, that was pretty close.

153
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,097
Close?

154
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:24,633
Close?! It's called The Price Is Right,
not The Price Is Close!

155
00:08:24,648 --> 00:08:26,661
Oh, man, this is bad.

156
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:29,017
If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't
get into the Showcase Showdown,

157
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:30,966
everything's ruined!
It's all ruined!

158
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:33,752
What is ruined?
Why, why is this such a big deal?

159
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:38,566
Okay, guys... sit down,
I've got to tell you something.

160
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:44,142
The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right

161
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:48,291
is because I've decided that it's time
for me to meet my real father.

162
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:50,262
- Your father?
- That's right.

163
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:56,557
My father... is Bob Barker.

164
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:08,106
- Your dad... is Bob Barker?
- That's right.

165
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,811
The host of The Price Is Right,
Bob Barker?

166
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:11,744
That's Pops.

167
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:14,089
- Barney?
- Yes, Robin?

168
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,931
Why in the world do you think
Bob Barker is your father?

169
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:20,988
Uh, because my mother told me
he was, that's why.

170
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:23,350
Mom, who's my dad?

171
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,139
All the other kids at school
know who their dad is.

172
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:30,059
- Who's mine?
- Oh, I don't know.

173
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:32,114
That guy.

174
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:37,862
Look, Dad, I got straight A's!

175
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:42,427
Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going
as for Halloween?

176
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:44,800
Want to play some catch, Pop?

177
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:52,261
So now I'm gonna go to L.A.,
be on the show,

178
00:09:52,276 --> 00:09:53,772
win the Showcase Showdown,

179
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:57,277
make him proud of me,
and then tell him who I am.

180
00:09:57,714 --> 00:10:01,889
You're gonna tell Bob Barker that
you're his son on national television?

181
00:10:02,423 --> 00:10:05,052
Why is this so hard for you
people to believe?

182
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:07,203
Drop the popper!

183
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,657
Lily has to gain five pounds
in a week and a half,

184
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,848
and it is my job to help her get there.

185
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:14,056
This is the best wedding diet ever.

186
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:18,469
- I lost a pound.
- That is impossible.

187
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:20,480
You ate McDonald's
every meal for three days.

188
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,285
I knew that Super Size
Me guy was full of it.

189
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:26,437
Well, it must be the wedding stress.
We just got to up the intake.

190
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:29,548
Lily Aldrin, drop and give me
20 bites of fudge!

191
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:31,903
Okay?

192
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:34,679
Don't nibble at it.
Attack it!

193
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:37,016
Come on, Lily.
You can do better than that!

194
00:10:37,018 --> 00:10:37,784
I can't.

195
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:40,321
Well, eat faster, before
your body figures out it's full.

196
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:43,397
I'm trying.
Oh, are you gonna cry?

197
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:46,066
You gonna cry?
Skinny little baby's gonna cry?

198
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:48,623
- Well, eat, damn it, eat!
- Okay!

199
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:57,643
Hey, so I think I figured out how to do
your toast in a completely appropriate way.

200
00:10:57,655 --> 00:10:59,325
- Finally.
- Yeah.

201
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:02,984
Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby,
Marshall's best man.

202
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,336
- Still strong, right?
- Great, yeah.

203
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:08,247
I'd like to share with you all a story
about the momentous evening last fall

204
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:10,931
when Marshall and Lily got back together.

205
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,323
Afterward, we stayed up
till 10:00 at night,

206
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:19,955
- doing shots of chocolate milk.
- Man, I'm well nourished right now!

207
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:22,376
Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.

208
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:26,153
Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us
you don't need alcohol to have fun.

209
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:30,188
Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents
for teaching me good values.

210
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,656
Now, I wasn't supposed
to hear this next part,

211
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:35,759
but Marshall leaned over
to Lily and whispered.

212
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:39,136
You know what I'd like
to do to you right now?

213
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:42,036
I'd like to hold your hand.

214
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,976
I'd like to hold your hand so hard

215
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,243
that you're not able
to shake hands for a week.

216
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:53,224
Are you just going to talk about holding
my hand or are you going to hold it?

217
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,891
Then a little later, Robin caught them...

218
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:01,593
Oh, um... ...holding hands.

219
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:06,051
It was a lovely and responsible night.

220
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:08,720
To Marshall and Lily.

221
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:12,298
That's the worst toast
I've ever heard, dude.

222
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:14,170
- It's totally boring.
- Exactly.

223
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:17,884
It's impossible to write a good toast
with you censoring me, man.

224
00:12:17,897 --> 00:12:18,891
I give up.

225
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:21,583
I'm just going to read that thing
about Jesus and the footprints.

226
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,579
I give up, too.
I don't care if my dress doesn't fit.

227
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:26,020
I can't eat anymore.

228
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,548
I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.

229
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:30,057
I know.

230
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,937
And so, Lily and I were
both about to give up,

231
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:37,318
but as you can all see,
Lily does look beautiful in that dress,

232
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:40,240
and here I am giving a toast.

233
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:44,939
You know, all this time, I'd been
wracking my brain trying to

234
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:48,468
pick out the perfect moment to capture
Lily and Marshall as a couple.

235
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:51,733
But then I realized the perfect
moment wasn't

236
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:54,761
some needle lost in the haystack
of their ten years together.

237
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:59,333
The perfect Lily and Marshall
moment happened two nights ago.

238
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,158
Marshall, what are you doing?

239
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:08,244
Going to the bathroom.

240
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,424
In the hall?

241
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:11,319
Sleepwalking?

242
00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:12,729
You're wide awake.

243
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:14,729
- Robbing us?
- Dude.

244
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:19,245
Turns out, all week long he'd been
sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd,

245
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,753
to meet Lily.

246
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:24,763
- God, I missed you.
- I can't sleep without you.

247
00:13:26,678 --> 00:13:28,116
Hey, baby?

248
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,486
- Would you be the big spoon for a while?
- Sure, baby.

249
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:40,368
- How's the weight gaining going?
- Ugh, terribly.

250
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:43,220
I'm too stressed out without you around.

251
00:13:44,426 --> 00:13:46,073
Well, I'm here now.

252
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:52,128
And so Lily and Marshall failed in
their experiment with apartness,

253
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:55,086
but they succeeded
in getting Lily into her dress.

254
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:59,630
You know, there really are a million things
I could tell you about Lily and Marshall,

255
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:02,955
but really, the only thing
you need to know is

256
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:05,686
that ten years into their relationship,

257
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:10,361
they still couldn't spend
a single night apart.

258
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:13,811
May they never have to again.

259
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:17,875
To Lily and Marshall.
To Lily and Marshall.

260
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,908
Now, kids, the story of Lily and
Marshall's wedding is a good one.

261
00:14:22,146 --> 00:14:24,167
No matter how perfectly you plan your...

262
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:26,051
You know, wait a second, guys.
I'll get to that.

263
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,119
First, I've got to tell you
what happened with Barney.

264
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:31,751
Rich, what is the name
of our next participant?

265
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:35,237
- Bob, it's Barney Stinson!
- Come on down!

266
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:37,629
You're the next contestant
on The Price Is Right.

267
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,082
Nooo. Oh, my God!

268
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:40,829
Working his way out.

269
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,388
High-five here, high-five there.

270
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:45,960
- A big old hug here.
- Oh, my God!

271
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,955
Yeah, I know, the camera loves me.

272
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:52,107
Welcome to contestant's row, Barney.
Nice suit.

273
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:56,159
- Thanks, Da... Bob.
- Here is the next item up for bid!

274
00:14:57,395 --> 00:15:01,936
Bob, the stylish his-and-her watches
feature an 18k gold bezel and crown

275
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:04,049
and stainless steel bands.

276
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:06,575
And Barney, what do you bid on that?

277
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:10,238
Um... Wrong.

278
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,592
Wrong.

279
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:12,564
Wrong.

280
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:13,562
Wrong.

281
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:19,207
Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since
you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob.

282
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:22,724
- $1,350 for Barney.
- So, was it $1,350?

283
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:24,041
I don't know.

284
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:26,830
- Was it?
- Oh, my God!

285
00:15:27,211 --> 00:15:28,849
Happy wedding.

286
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:33,741
Barney, you won that camcorder
in just one second!

287
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,565
That is impressive.
I mean impressive.

288
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,729
Thank you, Bob.

289
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:42,786
Now, to win the computer,
you're going to have to bid again,

290
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,253
and again I will say higher or lower.

291
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,504
And let's show the audience
the price of the computer,

292
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,414
and audience, please,
do not try to help us.

293
00:15:52,558 --> 00:15:55,647
And the clock will start
with your first bid.

294
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:58,110
- $1 billion.
- Lower.

295
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:00,751
So, I brought some photos
that I thought you might like to see.

296
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:03,142
- This is me on my first birthday.
- Yes, Barney.

297
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:04,921
- This is...
- What are you doing?

298
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:07,908
Uh, spending some quality
time with my dad.

299
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:11,505
That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving.

300
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:14,299
You have only about 16 seconds.
Keep bidding.

301
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:16,294
- No, no, I want you to see this. This is great.
- Keep bidding.

302
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,580
This is me at my graduation.
I know, the hair.

303
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:20,385
That, no, that's nice.
That's nice.

304
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,979
You have only five, four,
three, two, one...

305
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:26,670
- $999.
- Nine...

306
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:30,461
Barney, you got it exactly right!

307
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:33,764
- Happy wedding again!
- Oh, my...

308
00:16:35,502 --> 00:16:38,271
I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel
is the only weak part of my game.

309
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,154
I'm sure you'll do just fine, son.

310
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,211
Did you just...

311
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:48,565
- I'm ready, Bob.
- Do it! Do it! Here we go!

312
00:16:48,962 --> 00:16:51,301
He's looking for the dollar.

313
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:54,785
- It's going around, and around...
- Oh, no, you spun it too hard.

314
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,339
No, he didn't spin it hard enough.

315
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:58,049
Here it comes, Barney.

316
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:02,981
You got it!
You won...

317
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,131
But Barney...
Barney, you're not through.

318
00:17:11,206 --> 00:17:15,286
You've won $1,000.
You've won a place in the showcase.

319
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:18,533
You are doing splendidly so far.

320
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:20,760
Thank you, would you, would
you say you're proud of me?

321
00:17:20,777 --> 00:17:22,233
Sure.

322
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:26,671
That was kind of a weird moment.

323
00:17:28,484 --> 00:17:31,113
Very well, Barney, you have seen
the first showcase.

324
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:34,342
Do you want to bid on it
or do you want to pass it to Millie?

325
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:37,764
Please, no car and an above-ground spa?
Pass.

326
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:42,479
Millie, he has passed this showcase
to you. What do you bid on it?

327
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:48,391
- $17,640.
- $17,640.

328
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:53,286
Overbid!
Now, let's see Showcase #2.

329
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:56,639
Barney, your showcase
begins with a mystery.

330
00:17:56,654 --> 00:17:58,243
Oh, I love this.

331
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:00,713
I can't believe how excited I am right now.

332
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,279
Barney, you have seen your showcase.
What do you bid on it?

333
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:07,931
Please, please.

334
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,717
Please.

335
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:11,275
Let me.

336
00:18:16,556 --> 00:18:20,579
1-8-4-2-1.

337
00:18:20,806 --> 00:18:24,105
I don't even know what we're going to do
with a dune buggy, but I want it!

338
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:29,776
And the actual retail price
of your showcase is...

339
00:18:29,778 --> 00:18:35,695
- $14,628.
- $14,628. Millie, you are over.

340
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,647
Too bad.

341
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:42,644
Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase.

342
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:52,311
And the actual retail price of Barney's
showcase is... $18,421 exactly right!

343
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:57,529
- You win both showcases, Barney.
- Oh, my God!

344
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:05,066
Bob Barker, reminding you,
help control the pet...

345
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,172
Before, before we wrap up the show, there's
just something I want to say to you.

346
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:16,307
Congratulations on 35 wonderful
years hosting The Price Is Right.

347
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,353
Well, thank you, Barney.

348
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:21,051
Thank you...
Have your pets spayed or neutered.

349
00:19:24,938 --> 00:19:26,300
Why didn't you tell him?

350
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,622
Well, it's just...

351
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:33,262
If you lived your whole life
thinking one thing,

352
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:36,675
it would be pretty devastating
to find out that wasn't true.

353
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:41,163
I just don't think Bob
could have handled it.

354
00:19:42,378 --> 00:19:45,228
- Bob. Yeah.
- Probably a good choice.

355
00:19:46,742 --> 00:19:49,859
Anyway, on the bright side.

356
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:52,185
Happy wedding again!

357
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:54,647
And that's the story of how
Uncle Barney gave

358
00:19:54,649 --> 00:19:57,240
Lily and Marshall a dune buggy
for their wedding.

359
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,121
Hey Lily, I thought since we're
going to be apart for two whole weeks,

360
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,973
I would sing you your night-night song.

361
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:14,374
Night-night, Lily

362
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:17,506
Night-night, Lily

363
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:23,698
It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly,
little Lily Time to rest your little head

364
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:26,304
Sha-la-la-la-la

365
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,148
Sha-la-la-la-la

366
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:33,296
- Come on, Ted.
- No, it's weird.

367
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:34,652
You promised.

368
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:39,032
Sha-la-la-la-la

369
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:41,752
Sha-la-la-la-la

370
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:44,836
Sha-la-la-la-la
