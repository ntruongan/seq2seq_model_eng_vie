1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,711
Okay where were we?

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,655
It was June of 2006,

3
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:06,948
and life had just taken
an unexpected turn.

4
00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:10,013
Dad, can't you just skip ahead
to the part where you meet Mom?

5
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:12,364
I feel like you've been talking
for like a year.

6
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:14,975
Honey, all this stuff
I'm telling you is important.

7
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:16,498
It's all part of the story.

8
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:18,556
- Could I go to the bathroom?
- No.

9
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:23,686
The summer of 2006
was both wonderful and awful.

10
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,747
For me, it started out great.

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,782
In fact, day one was amazing.

12
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:30,030
I'd finally gotten together with Robin.

13
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,610
But while I'd been off having
one of the best nights of my life,

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,907
your uncle Marshall had been having
one of the worst nights of his.

15
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:42,651
So that's it?

16
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:43,909
We're breaking up?

17
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:46,403
Marshall, I'm sorry.
I just...

18
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,686
I just need to go to San Francisco
and do this art program and

19
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:52,632
-and figure out who I am outside of us.

20
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:55,998
And the only way
that I can do that is if...

21
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,861
if we don't talk for a while.

22
00:00:59,654 --> 00:01:00,748
For a while.

23
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:03,426
Try never, okay?

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,230
You walk out that door,
and we're done.

25
00:01:06,496 --> 00:01:08,915
You're never going
to hear my voice again.

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,612
I should call her.

27
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:12,081
- No, No.
- Ted it is--

28
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:14,395
If you call her when she asked you not to
you're just going to look weak

29
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:15,704
and you're going to regret it.

30
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:19,615
Now, listen, whenever you feel like
calling her, you come find me first.

31
00:01:20,169 --> 00:01:22,074
And I will punch you in the face.

32
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:24,508
You're a good friend, Ted.

33
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,833
Hey.

34
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:29,159
So, did you hear the big news?

35
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:31,337
You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up,

36
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,830
and Lily's gone and nothing else
even remotely important happened last night,

37
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:36,569
yeah, I think he knows.

38
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:37,854
Oh, my God.

39
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,041
I-I'm so sorry.
Wh--

40
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,199
What happened?

41
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,265
Well, she left.

42
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:45,882
And I don't even know
if she's coming back.

43
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,990
I didn't get your message until I woke up.

44
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:50,575
- Bro, I am so sorry.
- Thanks.

45
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,252
I know it must be tough,

46
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:55,524
but are you ready to hear something
that will not only make you feel better,

47
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,552
but will actively excite you?

48
00:01:57,558 --> 00:01:58,759
Sure.

49
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:05,071
For the first time, ever, the three of us
are single at the same time.

50
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:10,091
I've dreamed about this day, boys,
and it's going to be legendary.

51
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:12,775
Together, we will own this city.

52
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:17,209
Anytime a girl wants to get back
at her ex-boyfriends,

53
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:18,785
we'll be there.

54
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,680
Anytime a girl wants
to solve her father issues

55
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:26,853
through promiscuity and binge drinking,
we will be there.

56
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:31,245
Anytime a bachelorette party
drives through the city in a limo,

57
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:33,320
sticking their heads out
the sunroof shouting,

58
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:34,859
"What's up, New York?"

59
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:38,144
we will be what is up New York.

60
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:41,609
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on...

61
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:48,956
Aw, man, you guys did it, didn't you?

62
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,690
Sync by vNaru

63
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:05,948
One thing I learned that summer
is that when love is beginning...

64
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:13,216
...and love is ending,
the first 30 days are remarkably similar.

65
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,820
For one thing,
you spend most of your time in bed.

66
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:23,839
Your friends can't stand to listen to you.

67
00:03:27,617 --> 00:03:29,536
It was a really beautiful song.

68
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,711
So... stupid, man.

69
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:36,297
And you never seem to wear pants.

70
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:44,383
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hey, Ted.

71
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:45,649
You hungry?

72
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:47,468
What's the point?
I could eat some food.

73
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:49,422
It's just going to leave me.

74
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:52,439
Well, at least in that scenario
you get to do the dumping.

75
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:56,233
Come on, it's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.

76
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,907
Lily always made the pancakes.

77
00:03:59,442 --> 00:04:01,532
God, I loved her pancakes.

78
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:04,467
So soft.
So warm.

79
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:06,556
So perfectly shaped.

80
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:09,109
Are we still talking about her pancakes?

81
00:04:10,294 --> 00:04:12,565
Come on, you got to eat something;
what can I get you?

82
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,269
- Beer.
- No, that's what you had for dinner.

83
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:16,719
Fine.

84
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:18,905
Then I'll just have leftovers.

85
00:04:21,324 --> 00:04:24,613
So, he stays home all the time
not getting laid?

86
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:27,581
No, see, that's what you do
when you have a fiancée.

87
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:30,675
He should be down here celebrating.
He's free.

88
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:33,239
He got that redheaded tumor removed.

89
00:04:33,904 --> 00:04:36,205
You should write
and illustrate children's books.

90
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:38,622
You know what Marshall needs to do.

91
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:41,105
He needs to stop being sad.

92
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:45,281
When I get sad, I stop being sad
and be awesome instead.

93
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:47,177
True story.

94
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:49,790
It's only been a month.

95
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:51,390
He just needs to go at his own pace.

96
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:53,596
Anyway, Lily's the one
who caused this whole mess.

97
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,152
Hey, cut her some slack.

98
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:58,016
She's our friend, too.
She's just trying to figure out who she is.

99
00:04:58,021 --> 00:04:59,215
Figure out who she is?

100
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:01,233
Yeah, she should call me;
I got a whole list.

101
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:04,219
She's selfish.
She's immature. She's...

102
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:05,714
What?

103
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,340
God, your eyes are so blue.

104
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,476
Teddy Bear.

105
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:16,445
Oh that's a...

106
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:26,331
Yeah, it was hard to feel too bad.

107
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:29,872
I was dating the woman of my dreams,
and things were going great.

108
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:31,322
Well, for the most part.

109
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:33,229
So, I found her shampoo.

110
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:34,744
I guess she left it here.

111
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,623
It smells like her.

112
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:43,149
Like lavender and seashells and hope.

113
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:50,127
Somehow, erotic and comforting
all at the same time.

114
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,991
That's my shampoo.

115
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:55,788
Oh, sorry.

116
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:58,333
Mmm, I thought he'd never go to sleep.

117
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:02,135
- Uh-oh.
- Already?

118
00:06:04,316 --> 00:06:05,531
He's calling her.

119
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:08,444
- I don't hear any--
- He's calling her.

120
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:09,703
No.

121
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:13,755
Okay, you're right,
I won't call her.

122
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:16,040
I will not call her.

123
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,160
Well, I called her.

124
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:21,764
And get this, she changed her number.

125
00:06:21,768 --> 00:06:23,800
What, like I'm going to stalk her,
or something?

126
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:25,797
Like she's so special.

127
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,751
Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there.

128
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:30,667
'Cause there are four others
in the San Francisco area alone,

129
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:32,603
and they all seem a lot better than her

130
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:35,121
based on the brief conversations
I had with them.

131
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:38,244
- Does he know I'm in here?
- Yeah, hey, Robin.

132
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,579
- Anyways, one of the Lily Aldrins said...
- This has to stop.

133
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:43,396
Ted, we just started dating.

134
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:45,121
We agreed we don't want to move too fast,

135
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:47,051
and yet somehow, we have a baby.

136
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:48,797
He can't feed himself.

137
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:52,551
- He cries a lot, he keeps us up all night.
- Have you tried breast-feeding?

138
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:53,829
Nailed it!

139
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:56,701
Look, they were together nine years.

140
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,471
It's only been a month and a half.

141
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:00,208
He just needs to go at his own pace.

142
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:02,694
He slept on our floor last night, Ted.

143
00:07:02,696 --> 00:07:06,655
- He watched a scary movie.
- It is time for some tough love.

144
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:08,540
We need to get him out of that apartment.

145
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:11,087
He needs fresh air.
He needs sunshine.

146
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,520
Mmm, sunshine.

147
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:17,628
Gentlemen, please welcome
to the stage, Sunshine.

148
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:24,325
All right, I really don't think
this is going to help.

149
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:27,091
Do you know why
you're not over Lily yet?

150
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:29,249
It's 'cause you can still
picture her naked.

151
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:32,414
You can't get over a woman until
you can no longer picture her boobs;

152
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,691
it's a scientific fact.

153
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:39,939
The average male brain can only store
a finite number of boob images or "b-pegs".

154
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:43,315
And your hard drive's
filled to capacity with Lily's.

155
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:45,871
There are a lot of them.

156
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:48,305
Well, they won't go away
until you overwrite them

157
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:50,032
with images of other women's boobs.

158
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:53,974
Now, this journey may take
as many as a million boobs,

159
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:56,370
so we begin here tonight, my friend.

160
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:57,838
Two at a time.

161
00:07:58,154 --> 00:07:59,954
Those count as four.

162
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:05,608
Yeah.

163
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,560
This is fun right?
We're outside, it's a beautiful day.

164
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:10,499
The Indians are winning.

165
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:13,524
I got to admit,
it is really nice to be outside.

166
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,337
Yankee fans, please turn your attention
to the Diamond Vision for a special

167
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,991
- seventh-inning-stretch surprise
- Oh, no.

168
00:08:28,352 --> 00:08:30,243
It's all a big lie!

169
00:08:30,397 --> 00:08:32,499
She's just going to break your heart.

170
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:38,029
You can drag me out of here,
but she has no soul!

171
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:40,638
We've tried everything--
baseball, strippers.

172
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,715
The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.

173
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,382
I think he's beyond repair.

174
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:46,269
See, this is the problem with guys.

175
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:47,895
You don't know
how to deal with heartbreak.

176
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:50,531
Oh, and what's your prescription,
Dr. Estrogen?

177
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:54,233
Eat Haagen-Dazs and watch Love Actually,
till your periods sync up.

178
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:02,508
Yeah, that's the stuff.

179
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:04,078
Oh, my God.

180
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:05,745
How long have you been doing this?

181
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,121
Well, my dad taught me to shoot
when I was a kid.

182
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:10,657
Whenever I'm feeling lonely
or depressed, I come here,

183
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:14,038
and it reminds me that... guns are fun.

184
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:21,318
Um, you know,
Ted is kind of against guns.

185
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:24,161
And that's why
Ted's never going to find out about this.

186
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:28,047
Whoa, that sounded kind of scary
with me holding a gun, didn't it?

187
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:30,412
No, I-I just mean, please don't tell Ted.

188
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:32,238
You want to try?

189
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:34,734
Only hell yeah.

190
00:09:35,377 --> 00:09:37,838
Oh, yeah, yeah, this is what I needed.

191
00:09:38,314 --> 00:09:41,582
I felt so powerless this whole time,
but this...

192
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:44,977
this is power.
This is...

193
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:49,499
I should of mentioned the recoil.

194
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,975
I got to hand it to you, when he got home,
Marshall was smiling--

195
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:54,262
did you sleep with him?

196
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:57,106
'Cause I was actually, like,
three days away from suggesting that.

197
00:09:57,112 --> 00:10:00,451
Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch
with your feminine side.

198
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:06,482
- Yeah, yeah!
- Well, congratulations.

199
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:08,637
You're the first person
to cheer him up all summer.

200
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:10,394
- You win.
- Oh, what do I win?

201
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,681
I'll tell you what you win:
I'm taking you away this weekend.

202
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,098
You are?
That's so nice.

203
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:17,164
Yeah, my aunt and uncle
have a beach house out in Montauk,

204
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,591
oh, it's really romantic.

205
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:20,608
My uncle's had like three affairs there.

206
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:24,453
Wow, must be a nice house,
I've seen pictures of your uncle.

207
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:27,287
This is going to be so great.

208
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,073
We'll finally get some time alone.

209
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:31,481
Are you sure Marshall's
going to be okay with this?

210
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:34,634
Yeah, absolutely.
Dude, I'm doing much better.

211
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:36,450
In fact, take my car.

212
00:10:36,455 --> 00:10:37,451
- Really?
- Yeah.

213
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:39,208
Hey, thanks... and, hey,

214
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:41,504
if you need anything day or night,
just call me--

215
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:43,320
You know what, please don't call me.

216
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:45,896
What? What's wrong?

217
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,289
It's, uh, Lily's credit card bill.

218
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,585
She must have forgotten
to switch her address.

219
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,354
So?

220
00:10:52,138 --> 00:10:55,061
So, I wonder what kind of charges
she's making out there in San Francisco.

221
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:57,265
No. No, no good can come
from looking at this.

222
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,513
- You've made too much progress already.
- I know but I just, maybe the--

223
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:00,342
No!

224
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:02,987
You're going to thank me for this.

225
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:08,026
You're a good friend, Ted.

226
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:12,162
August 5th, one charge-- tickets.

227
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:16,245
To what? George Clinton
and the P-Funk All-Stars.

228
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,119
August 10th, one charge: Tennis Emporium.

229
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:23,591
August 18th, two charges: Mario's Bistro

230
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:26,467
and, get this, Pet Palace.

231
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:29,700
You guys see what this means, right?

232
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,742
Wow, Mario's Bistro.

233
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:37,646
What a perfect place to whore around.

234
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:40,202
Only the best for my little Lily pad.

235
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:45,584
Oh, funk legend George Clinton,
I am so glad you spotted me at your concert

236
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:49,307
and dragged me on stage to dance
with you Courtney Cox-style.

237
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:52,041
And I'm so glad you agreed
to play tennis with me.

238
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:56,623
You know, Marshall tried to get me
to play tennis for nine years,

239
00:11:56,628 --> 00:12:00,068
but I didn't do it,
because I never truly loved him.

240
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:02,595
I got you a gift.

241
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:06,409
Oh ! A ferret.

242
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:10,261
Oh, I'll buy it some food next door
at the Pet Palace.

243
00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:12,906
Oh, I've always wanted one,

244
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:15,852
but Marshall had
this secret phobia of ferrets.

245
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:18,747
I bet that's something
he made you promise not to tell nobody.

246
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,364
It was.

247
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,123
Oh.

248
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,946
I love you, funk legend George Clinton.

249
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,964
I love you, too, Lily.

250
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:29,609
That's right, Marshall, she's all mine.

251
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,356
Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.

252
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,252
♪ Ow, we want the funk. ♪

253
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:35,279
♪ Give up the funk... ♪

254
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:37,155
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

255
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,803
Yeah, why are you afraid of ferrets?
They're adorable.

256
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:42,855
Because, Robin,
they're like fuzzy, tube-shaped rats.

257
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:45,672
Plus, those charges are from,
like, a month ago.

258
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:46,312
Exactly.

259
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:48,466
For new charges,
you have to go to her online account.

260
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:51,681
You can see credit card activity from,
like, two hours ago.

261
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:55,983
But, you know, don't.

262
00:12:58,374 --> 00:13:00,994
Why do you talk?
Why do you talk?!

263
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,869
He needs her password.
It's not like he has her password.

264
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:05,768
Ooh, this is good, he has her password.

265
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:10,649
There's a charge from earlier today:
the Kellett Hotel on 5th.

266
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:14,622
I don't believe this.
Lily's back in New York.

267
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:18,839
I can't believe this.

268
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:20,514
Lily's in New York?

269
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:23,927
I-I guess I've been thinking
when she got back, she'd call me.

270
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:27,790
That's really the only reason I've been able
to hold it together so far this summer.

271
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:29,724
This has been "holding it together"?

272
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,141
Okay, you know what?
I'm calling her.

273
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:33,440
- No.
- Ted, give me the phone.

274
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:34,819
You're not calling her,
this changes nothing.

275
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:36,134
You, come here.

276
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,837
Look, while we're away this weekend,
can you keep an eye on him,

277
00:13:39,844 --> 00:13:41,398
make sure he doesn't call that hotel?

278
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:42,742
You want me to babysit him?

279
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,150
20 bucks.

280
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:45,369
An hour.

281
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:46,667
And money for pizza.

282
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:50,292
Uh, yeah, how about you do it for free or
every time we hang out, you have to watch this?

283
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:51,110
Come here.

284
00:13:51,116 --> 00:13:54,005
- My little blue-eyed baby, baby lips.
- Ooh, ooh, sugar, sugar...

285
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:57,728
Okay, I'll do it!
Stop being a couple.

286
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:00,353
- Marshall.
- Marshall, Marshall!

287
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:02,170
Ted, I know I shouldn't do this,
but I have to!

288
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:02,810
- You call her...
- We were together...

289
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:04,097
- for nine years!
- ...and everything we've been working so hard for

290
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:05,366
is completely flushed down the toi...

291
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,400
Hello, Lily Aldrin's room, please.

292
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:09,469
Thank you.

293
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:11,287
- Hang up now.
- Ted, I can't hang up now.

294
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,185
- Hang up now.
- The missiles are in the air,

295
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:13,661
- and I know that you don't approve.
- Hang up.

296
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:14,280
Hello.

297
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,175
Uh, a guy answered.

298
00:14:22,932 --> 00:14:24,821
There's-there's a guy in her room.

299
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:29,086
- I'm going down there.
- Dude, you can't do that.

300
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:30,962
I have to go down there,
and I have to tell her I love her;

301
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:32,441
I have to beg her to take me back,

302
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:33,817
even if I have to get down on my knees.

303
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,923
- Marshall, you can't do that.
- Oh, really, why not?

304
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,682
56 days.

305
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:40,136
That's how long it took me
to get right about here.

306
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:42,082
Because you're pathetic!

307
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:46,984
I'm sorry, but right now,
you are not Marshall.

308
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:52,156
You are the miserable, whining,
shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall,

309
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,490
and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have
a shot in hell with a girl like Lily.

310
00:14:55,705 --> 00:14:58,274
You know who might have a shot
somewhere down the line.

311
00:14:58,778 --> 00:14:59,765
Marshall.

312
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:01,291
The real Marshall.

313
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:03,157
But if you go down there
right now like this,

314
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:05,792
you're going to blow it for him,
and he's never going to forgive you.

315
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:09,335
Of course, whatever I say,
you're just going to do the opposite, so

316
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,871
have a great weekend.
Good luck screwing up your life.

317
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:13,012
Come on, Robin.

318
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:19,449
Is it still okay if we borrow the car?

319
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,691
Bold. Bold to go for the car.

320
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:28,556
What?

321
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,621
I didn't say a thing.

322
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:32,869
You think I was too hard on him.

323
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:34,453
I didn't say a thing.

324
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,770
I can't believe you're accusing me
of being too hard on him.

325
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:38,260
You're the one who said "tough love."

326
00:15:38,263 --> 00:15:40,803
Yeah, tough love,
not "hand the guy a noose."

327
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,929
Oh, but it's okay
to hand him a nine millimeter?

328
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:46,216
Yeah, he told me.

329
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:49,988
So you're a gun nut?

330
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:52,016
No, I'm a gun enthusiast.

331
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,504
- Do you know how many people...
- The Second Amendment...

332
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:54,999
- are killed each year in accidents...
- protects my right to bear arms...

333
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:57,058
All right, all right, all right.

334
00:15:57,253 --> 00:15:58,654
I was too hard on him.

335
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:01,011
A little.

336
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:06,092
I'm going to call Barney,
see how they're doing.

337
00:16:07,224 --> 00:16:08,096
Go for Barney.

338
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,427
Oh, hey, where are you guys?

339
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:13,050
We're at a fundraiser, helping young women
raise money for community college.

340
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,416
Strip club, nice.

341
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:15,755
Is Marshall okay?

342
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,971
Yeah, he's here and he's great.
Uh, hang on.

343
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:19,497
Marshall?
Tell Ted that--

344
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:21,916
Uh-oh.

345
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,022
Already?

346
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:25,569
What? What uh-oh?

347
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:26,986
He's gone.

348
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:28,182
You lost him?

349
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,222
I can't believe this.
He's gonna go down to that hotel.

350
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:32,696
Crap, you're right. Okay, okay,
here's the plan, here's the plan.

351
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,782
You go down to the hotel and find him.

352
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:36,880
I'll stay here and get a lap dance.
On three. One, two...

353
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:37,746
Barney!

354
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,553
Was there a hot tub at your uncle's place?

355
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,320
A really nice one.

356
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,909
Hi, uh, could you tell me
what room Lily Aldrin's in?

357
00:16:56,002 --> 00:16:56,935
Marshall.

358
00:16:57,427 --> 00:16:58,441
Hey.

359
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:01,568
What happened?

360
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:05,202
Well, I went up to Lily's floor,

361
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:07,216
and I had this little speech in my head--

362
00:17:07,223 --> 00:17:11,950
everything I've been wanting to say to her
all summer about love, loyalty, respect.

363
00:17:12,223 --> 00:17:13,598
I knocked on the door.

364
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,438
So you knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?

365
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:24,339
Yeah.

366
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:26,133
It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.

367
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,763
What? Who-- who was it?

368
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:29,627
His name was Joey Adalian,

369
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:33,231
although he went by a number
of aliases in his years as an identity thief.

370
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:35,480
Apparently, earlier in the summer...

371
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:38,934
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

372
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,249
I-I could have sworn I had some change.

373
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,204
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

374
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:46,400
Oh, here we go.

375
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:48,886
No, that's-that's a button.

376
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:50,502
It was a button.

377
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:56,563
- Do you, uh, take credit cards?
- Yes, I do.

378
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,646
So Lily's not back in town,
and she doesn't have a boyfriend?

379
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,072
Th-That's good news, right?

380
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:02,951
Yeah.

381
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:05,138
I don't know.

382
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:09,839
Those credit card charges were the only
remaining connection I had to her.

383
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:13,945
I don't know where she is
or what she's doing.

384
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,736
She was my whole life, man,
and now she's-she's gone.

385
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,993
You know, first day of college, I showed up,

386
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:31,283
I was so freaked out, and-and I got up
to my room, and there was my roommate,

387
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:34,388
lying on the bed
with his feet up on the wall.

388
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:38,723
Had headphones on, big smile on his face
like he just didn't give a crap.

389
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:40,567
Happy.

390
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:41,916
Confident.

391
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:43,515
Not afraid of anything.

392
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:45,981
That guy was you.

393
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:48,465
You before you met Lily.

394
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:51,570
Ted?

395
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:52,887
Yeah?

396
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,304
I was high that day.

397
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:58,447
I was. I was so high,
I thought you were the dean.

398
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:08,153
Wh-What I'm saying is there's a version
of you without Lily, and it's not this.

399
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:13,493
You can't let Lily steal your identity
the way that guy stole hers.

400
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:16,897
Okay.

401
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:20,283
Okay, resolved.

402
00:19:20,737 --> 00:19:23,964
Starting tomorrow,
I'm going to start being okay.

403
00:19:24,778 --> 00:19:26,161
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

404
00:19:33,313 --> 00:19:37,043
But he wasn't,
'cause that's not how life works.

405
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:39,590
The next day,
he found one of her socks or something,

406
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,376
and we were back to square one.

407
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:45,849
And then, one morning...

408
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:48,285
Ted, I think you should see this.

409
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,631
Oh, no, what now?

410
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,963
Marshall, what are you doing?

411
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:56,618
It's Sunday.

412
00:19:57,502 --> 00:19:58,695
It's pancakes day.

413
00:20:03,864 --> 00:20:08,179
It took him 67 days and
one really disgusting batch of pancakes...

414
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,270
So good.

415
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:16,026
So good.

416
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:19,181
...but Marshall
had come back from the dead.

417
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,266
Because while baseball, strippers,
and guns can help,

418
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:26,361
the only thing that
can really heal a broken heart is time.
