1
00:00:00,424 --> 00:00:02,057
It took me a while to figure out

2
00:00:02,065 --> 00:00:05,009
but the key to understanding
your Uncle Barney is this.

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:08,434
When times are hard,
it's impossible to keep him around.

4
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,003
Like when your aunt Lily
and Uncle Marshall were broken up.

5
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:13,018
Hey. What are you guys talking about?

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,228
- Lily.
- I got to go.

7
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:20,299
But when times are good,
it's impossible to get rid of him.

8
00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:21,287
What are you guys doing?

9
00:00:21,307 --> 00:00:23,124
We just finished planning
Marshall's bachelor party.

10
00:00:23,128 --> 00:00:25,101
Good, you haven't started yet.
Let's talk logistics.

11
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:27,702
Now, have you laid out
ground rules with Lily?

12
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:30,268
Where you are or aren't allowed
to touch or be touched?

13
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,381
Show me on Ted.

14
00:00:31,673 --> 00:00:34,496
Actually, we're, uh, we're thinking
of skipping the strippers.

15
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:38,099
You... you want to have a party
without strippers.

16
00:00:38,114 --> 00:00:39,848
This was the worse thing
I could have said.

17
00:00:39,864 --> 00:00:42,581
You see, uncle Barney loved
cooking up bachelor parties.

18
00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:44,512
And it was always the same recipe.

19
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:47,531
You start with a slightly
cramped hotel suite.

20
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:49,933
Arrange the chairs in a circle...

21
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:52,504
Fill them with your closest friends.

22
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,763
Turn the heat up to about 90.

23
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:57,265
Pump in a metric ton of cigar smoke.

24
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:01,265
And then, right in the middle
of the room, you throw in a girl.

25
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,038
But not a beautiful girl--

26
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,049
no, if this girl was ever beautiful,
it was two kids,

27
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:09,560
three tattoos and one pesky
substance abuse problem ago.

28
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:12,383
Which one of you is Stuart?

29
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,202
Please, I really don't want to do this.

30
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:16,912
Shut up, put in your mouth guard.

31
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:24,195
Then she proceeds to do things
that demean the groom,

32
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:26,987
herself and really,
the entire human race.

33
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:28,276
Disgusting.

34
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,249
Ah, horrifying.

35
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:33,361
- Classic.
- Oh, please, please, no, no.

36
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:35,899
I don't want anything like that
happening to me.

37
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:37,721
Stuart's still trying
to forget that night.

38
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:40,360
It's my bachelor party.
We're not having strippers.

39
00:01:40,377 --> 00:01:42,392
Oh, he thinks he has a sain it.

40
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:44,102
So, strippers it is!

41
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,795
Now, just, uh, tell me where we're going
to be and I'll make some calls.

44
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:55,927
- Barney, there is...
- Before you say no, it has attachments.

45
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:00,286
Sync by vNaru

46
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:13,323
Look, I know you have some stuff planned
for Marshall's bachelor party,

47
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:15,766
- but he really doesn't want strippers.
- Yes, he does.

48
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:19,108
- Uh, well, he told me he doesn't.
- Uh, well, he told me he does.

49
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:20,919
- When?
- Every minute of every day

50
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:25,129
as his inner animal thrashes against the
cage of his own puritanical upbringing.

51
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,582
Or do you guys not like naked girls.

52
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:30,603
Um, we love naked girls.

53
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,071
They're one of the best things
in the world.

54
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:35,373
It goes... naked girls, democracy,

55
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,425
the scene in Every Which Way But Loose
where the monkey gives a guy the finger.

56
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:41,845
- We just don't like your naked girls.
- What, my girls aren't hot enough?

57
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:46,267
I mean, all right, fine, the stripper at
Stuart's bachelor party was a 15.

58
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:50,931
- She was 15?
- No, a 15. Like in blackjack.

59
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:53,921
As in, not sure whether you'd hit it?

60
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:55,991
- Exactly.
- Nice.

61
00:02:57,008 --> 00:03:01,352
This is important to Marshall.
So, promise me, no strippers.

62
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:03,563
All right, I promise.

63
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:08,778
- I'm serious.
- So am I. No strippers.

64
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:12,217
Now say it without winking.

65
00:03:12,744 --> 00:03:14,359
No strippers.

66
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:18,591
- You just winked.
- No I didn't.

67
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:25,314
So, when the day arrived, we all climbed
into a rented Escalade and set out.

68
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:29,456
Now, every bachelor party is usually
made up of the same stock characters.

69
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,035
You've got the groom...

70
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:32,436
the best man...

71
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,017
- the guy who speaks only in clichÃ©s...
- Dead man walking!

72
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:39,237
...the guy who disappears
at the beginning of the night

73
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,908
and doesn't show up again until the end.

74
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:44,049
All right, who's up for a little
blackjack before we check in.

75
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:46,340
- No, no, no.
- None for me.

76
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,491
See you guys back at the room, then.

77
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:51,972
And, of course, well... Barney.

78
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:55,684
Every bachelor party has a Barney.
Oh, what's this?

79
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,285
This car has a DVD player?
You mean,

80
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:02,548
we could have been watching
these pornos the whole time?

81
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,629
- Yeah.
- This one's in HD.

82
00:04:05,052 --> 00:04:08,348
This one's in H-double-D.
Oh!

83
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:12,249
That same night, aunt Lily
was having a wedding shower.

84
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:14,210
And Robin showed up gift in hand.

85
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:15,992
Funny story about that gift.

86
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,894
Hey, Barney, check out
what I got Lily for her shower.

87
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:21,176
It's kind of racy.
Think you can handle it?

88
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:23,876
Uh, I've been in a ten-way.
So, yeah.

89
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:32,420
- It's kind of see-through.
- Whoa, ho ho!

90
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:35,611
You weren't kidding! You know
when you should give that to her?

91
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:37,452
1850.

92
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:40,101
Robin, it's her bridal shower!

93
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:42,084
All her friends are gonna be there,
they're going to be drinking.

94
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:44,605
You need to get her something daring,
something outrageous.

95
00:04:44,757 --> 00:04:46,864
Well, what do you think
I should get her?

96
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,876
There's a store on Eighth Avenue
that specializes in--

97
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:53,747
how to put this delicately?--

98
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:59,320
uh, battery-powered, adult-
recreational fake penises.

99
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:03,329
And so Aunt Robin went
to a store on Eighth Avenue,

100
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:06,492
and a battery-powered,
adult-recreational...

101
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,342
Well, it was something inappropriate.
And we're back in.

102
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:16,175
Robin!

103
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,136
I'm so glad you're here.

104
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:20,659
Come in, I want you to meet everybody.

105
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:23,939
Robin, this is my Grandma Lois
and my Aunt Florence.

106
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:25,808
Oh, lovely to meet you, dear.

107
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:27,879
They put this whole party together.

108
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:32,021
It's different from what I expected,
but lovely.

109
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:33,243
Lovely.

110
00:05:33,257 --> 00:05:34,693
And oh, look, there are little kids here!

111
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,775
Yeah, my cousins.

112
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:39,106
Listen, I, uh, I forgot something
somewhere so I'm going to just go...

113
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:41,107
Robin, this is my mom, Janice.

114
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:44,227
Oh, honey.
I'm so glad to finally meet you.

115
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,148
Me too.
I, I've heard so much about you.

116
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:49,120
Me, too. Oh, here.
Let me take your gift.

117
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:55,422
Can I guess what it is?
Is it a, a, a mini food processor?

118
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:57,061
- No.
- No? Oh.

119
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:58,923
Oh, give me a hint.
What color is it?

120
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:00,984
Black.

121
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,315
Well, I guess I'm just going
to have to wait and see!

122
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,605
- Oh, great.
- Robin...

123
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,519
- this is my Cousin Margaret.
- Oh, finally, someone our own age!

124
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,490
Wait, do I introduce you as
"Cousin Margaret" or "Sister Margaret?"

125
00:06:16,494 --> 00:06:19,391
Well, I'm not officially confirmed
as a nun until next month

126
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:23,902
and I don't want to tick off the Big Guy,
so let's stick with "Cousin" for now.

127
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,994
God's watching.
Excellent!

128
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:33,344
Man, they spent a lot of money
on this porno.

129
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,557
Whoa-- Morgan Freeman?
Man, that guy's in everything.

130
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:40,980
Aw, man, I grabbed
the wrong Deep Impact!

131
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:43,668
No, leave it in, it's a good movie.

132
00:06:43,684 --> 00:06:47,630
- But, dude, there's no sex in it.
- Yeah, just like marriage. Huh? Right?

133
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:51,443
Oh, oh, hey, check this out!
Don't ask how,

134
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:55,382
but I procured for us five loco-bueno,

135
00:06:55,397 --> 00:06:58,014
hand-rolled, highly illegal Cubans.

136
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:00,184
Seriously, you could go to jail
for smoking these things.

137
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:02,775
Marriage is like jail!
Right, fellas?!

138
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:06,737
But at least in jail,
you get to have sex!

139
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:13,339
But we're not lighting these babies up,
till we get to the A.C.

140
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:14,433
A.C.?

141
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:17,281
Um, Atlantic City.
Try to keep up, Brad.

142
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:19,342
We're not going to Atlantic City.

143
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,418
Just a second, Brad.

144
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,132
- Hi.
- Hi.

145
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:31,086
We're still going
to Atlantic City, right?

146
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:34,619
Oh, did I not tell you? Yeah, we
switched it. We're going to Foxwoods.

147
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:36,199
Foxwoods?

148
00:07:36,235 --> 00:07:42,541
But I've got an ipperstray
waiting in tlanticaay itycay.

149
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:44,333
What the heck's in Foxwoods?

150
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:47,555
Well, we've got five third row seats
to the Popinski-Salazar rematch.

151
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:50,095
They've set aside
our very own craps table,

152
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,105
and I reserved a private room
for us at Connelly's,

153
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:54,767
where the five of us are going
to be sharing a 102-ounce steak

154
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,226
from a cow that I picked out
on the Internet.

155
00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:59,908
- Yeah.
- Great. The night's ruined.

156
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:02,910
Sorry, Barney.
It was an honest mistake.

157
00:08:06,997 --> 00:08:09,151
This is going to be great!

158
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,414
Meat, violence,
throwing money down the toilet.

159
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,656
America-- one;
every other country-- zero.

160
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:16,714
- Thanks, guys.
- Yeah.

161
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,516
- You okay, Barney?
- What can I say, Ted? You won.

162
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:22,916
Hi.

163
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:26,038
You one... sad, pathetic loser.

164
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:28,689
Boys, say hello to Treasure.

165
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:30,440
Hi, Treasure.

166
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:34,161
- I can't believe that you did this.
- I had to.

167
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:35,532
- I'm your best man.
- Ted's my best man.

168
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:37,495
You've yet to make a decision
and that's fine.

169
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:41,395
But as your best-man-to-be, it's my job
to make sure at your bachelor party

170
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,236
you see a woman take her clothes off while
dancing to Whitesnake's "Here I Go Again."

171
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:51,510
All right, fine, but...
let's make it fast, all right.

172
00:08:51,524 --> 00:08:53,260
The fight starts in an hour
we don't want to miss it.

173
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:55,791
It's a girl taking her clothes off.
How long can it take?

174
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:57,483
It's a bit more complicated than that.

175
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,811
I need two grounded sockets, a large
sterile pot filled with hot water

176
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:03,013
and you all need to sign these releases.

177
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:11,185
An egg beater!
Aw, thank you, Aunt Sylvia!

178
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:12,966
I love that it's cordless.

179
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:14,726
Well, at least I got that part right.

180
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:18,520
All of these gifts are so thoughtful.

181
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:19,939
Lily?

182
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:23,471
I need you to look at me right now
and read my mind.

183
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:26,674
- Oh, my God! You're hearing me!
- Yeah!

184
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:29,473
Sorry this party's so boring.
What's up?

185
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:33,847
Do not open my gift.
See what I'm doing here?

186
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:37,535
I'm looking over at the gift,
then back at you,

187
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,409
and I'm shaking my head, "no."

188
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:43,928
Gift. You. No.

189
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:47,759
- Are you getting that?
- I totally got it.

190
00:09:54,257 --> 00:09:56,135
Here you go.

191
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:59,814
Lily said it was your time of the month.

192
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:01,948
You're welcome.

193
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:08,947
What are you doing?

194
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:14,981
Oh, just, um... rearranging the gifts.
The pile looked a bit precarious. So...

195
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:17,241
Oh, don't worry, I'll keep an eye on it.

196
00:10:17,438 --> 00:10:19,441
Great. You do that.

197
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,874
You're gonna make a damn good nun.

198
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:29,288
As many times as Robin told
this story over the years,

199
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,758
she would never quite be able
to explain the logic of her next move.

200
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:41,940
Is this a strip show or a Kiss concert?

201
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:43,981
Shh! She's starting.

202
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:47,735
Please turn off your cell phones,
pagers and sense of shame.

203
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:54,015
All right, boys. Lie back, get
comfortable, and enjoy the show.

204
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:01,309
Of course there's no way
I'm telling you about her show.

205
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:03,498
- So, let's skip ahead a little.
- Ow!

206
00:11:04,304 --> 00:11:06,611
Oh my God, are you all right?

207
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:09,453
No, I am not all right, you idiot.
My ankle is broken!

208
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:12,635
- Take me to the hospital!
- Um, actually, we have tickets.

209
00:11:14,788 --> 00:11:16,354
You know what?
Thanks a lot, Barney.

210
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:17,744
She told you at the beginning of the show

211
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,086
not to use the smoke machine
when she's on the hippity hop.

212
00:11:20,103 --> 00:11:22,799
Now I'm going to have to spend the rest
of my bachelor party in a hospital.

213
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,550
Well, hey, maybe
we'll get to see her X-rays.

214
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:26,449
The ultimate strip show.

215
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:30,271
- X-rays. More like triple X-rays.
- Just stop.

216
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:33,682
Which exit is the hospital?

217
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:35,593
What if she doesn't make it
to the hospital?

218
00:11:35,617 --> 00:11:37,202
Barney, please calm down.

219
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:38,623
Maybe we should just
take her to the desert,

220
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:40,495
bury her and wash our hands
of this whole thing!

221
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,116
Dude, what is the matter with you?

222
00:11:42,131 --> 00:11:44,266
I'm just trying to illustrate
to Marshall that as his best man...

223
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:46,148
- You're not my best man.
- As his best man,

224
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:48,008
I would help him bury
a hooker in the desert.

225
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:49,907
- I'm not a hooker.
- And you're not my best man.

226
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:51,568
You've ruined my bachelor party.

227
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:54,521
I don't know why you wouldn't just listen
to me when I said I didn't want this.

228
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:57,269
Well, the fight started ten minutes ago.
Maybe-maybe we should listen.

229
00:11:57,594 --> 00:11:59,211
Oh, Doctor, what a fight!

230
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:01,804
That knockout will be talked about
for years to come!

231
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:03,652
Anyone lucky enough to be
in the arena tonight

232
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:06,423
just witnessed boxing history
in the making!

233
00:12:07,981 --> 00:12:12,607
Thank you so much, Margaret. I can't
believe you carved that crucifix yourself.

234
00:12:12,622 --> 00:12:14,199
So talented.

235
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:16,248
Didn't think you could carve.

236
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:23,690
For you.
Oh. And this one's from...

237
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:27,142
- Grandma Lois.
- Oh. No, wait, darling.

238
00:12:28,906 --> 00:12:32,134
Before you open this,
I-I want to say a few words.

239
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,875
Okay, something you need to know.

240
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,616
Grandma Lois thought she was giving her
granddaughter an antique sewing machine.

241
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:40,857
And we're back in.

242
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:47,441
Honey, this handy little device has been
in our family for generations.

243
00:12:47,457 --> 00:12:50,320
I used it,
your great grandmother used it.

244
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:54,862
Now, her mother didn't use this one,
but she used one just like it.

245
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:57,574
Of course, back then,
they were made out of wood.

246
00:12:57,898 --> 00:13:01,575
And, uh, I guess before that,
you just had to do it by hand.

247
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,796
- Would you pass the wine, please?
- No.

248
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:07,078
Hey, Marshall,

249
00:13:07,283 --> 00:13:09,490
while we're here, you may as well
go down to the morgue and

250
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:12,561
climb into a drawer, 'cause
that's what marriage is like.

251
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:14,059
Can I get an amen?

252
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:18,612
- Is everything all right at home, Stuart?
- No.

253
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:28,865
It's broken.

254
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:33,426
Oh, damn it, this is bad.
I really can't lose this job.

255
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:38,741
My daughters are about to start school,
and my fiancÃ©, well...

256
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:42,872
ever since he got back from Iraq,
pretty much all he does is drink.

257
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,444
I think about leaving him, but...

258
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,634
I don't want my girls growing up
without a dad like I did.

259
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,187
I don't want them
to know what that's like.

260
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,708
- So, show time?
- What is the matter with you?

261
00:13:58,832 --> 00:14:00,298
Her ankle's broken.

262
00:14:00,313 --> 00:14:03,289
I know for a fact that
the second half of her act

263
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:05,919
takes place largely
in a seated or supine position.

264
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:07,181
Oh, that's true.

265
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:10,493
Treasure, please,
don't worry about the show.

266
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:12,223
Uh, we'd feel bad.

267
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,263
What does that mean?

268
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,286
No. We just mean, uh,
you're off the hook.

269
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,617
You don't have to do it.

270
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:20,467
I don't have to do it?
Well, guess what?

271
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:25,198
I know I don't have to do it.
I do it because I am good at it.

272
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:27,029
Look, I don't need your pity.

273
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:31,129
All I want to do is give you a great show
because you're getting married!

274
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:35,223
Is that so much to ask?
Is that such a major inconvenience?!

275
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:47,977
Oh, that is wrong.

276
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:50,839
Oh, that's just so wrong.

277
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:55,668
Well, the doctor did say for her
to keep it elevated.

278
00:15:00,185 --> 00:15:04,183
When I was a girl, my mother taught me
and my sister to use it.

279
00:15:04,247 --> 00:15:07,506
We used to have contests
to see who could finish faster.

280
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,356
It was so exciting. The whole family
would gather around to watch.

281
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,287
And when I was a new bride,
this is what kept me buzy

282
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:20,060
all those long nights when
your grandfather was in Korea.

283
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:23,290
And speaking of your grandfather,

284
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:27,804
though I don't think he'd care to admit
this to any of his army buddies, but...

285
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,294
he'd have a go at it
every once in a while.

286
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:33,574
And he enjoyed it.

287
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,857
Oh, open it up, sweetie.

288
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,217
May this give for you as much joy
as it's brought me.

289
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:04,896
Grandma, um...

290
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:07,779
Wow.

291
00:16:08,596 --> 00:16:12,684
Well, take it out, honey.
I want to show you how to use it.

292
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,615
Okay, no, no!
Don't take it out.

293
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:19,557
Lily, that's not your grandma's gift.
It's mine.

294
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:23,748
I panicked, and I switched the cards
because I was embarrassed.

295
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,309
Well, what is it?

296
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:39,513
It's just like the one Miranda gave
to Charlotte on Sex and the City.

297
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:43,287
Oh, I love that show.
I always watch it on TBS.

298
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,915
Oh, you would.
You're such a Samantha!

299
00:16:45,932 --> 00:16:48,429
Oh, I'm a Carrie!
You're a Samantha!

300
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:52,861
And then the night became
a whole new kind of uncomfortable.

301
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:56,671
- So where do I get one of these?
- Mom!

302
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:02,403
Man, what a show, huh?

303
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:05,263
She did some disgusting stuff.
Really sticks with you.

304
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:08,444
I may be done eating.

305
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:09,845
Me, too.

306
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,928
I mean, like, forever.

307
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,479
Me, too.

308
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:15,306
I miss my wife.

309
00:17:17,073 --> 00:17:20,599
Hey, let's go around the table
and say what our favorite part was.

310
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,012
Mine was that thing with the typewriter.

311
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:26,342
I mean, she made some
spelling mistakes, but still.

312
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,913
Ooh, and you guys were all,
"Barney, put out the cigar!

313
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:33,434
It's a non-smoking room!" And I was all,
"Hell, no, this is a Cuban!"

314
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:36,806
Of course, eventually,
I did put it out.

315
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,867
Did I put it out?

316
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:40,626
I put it out.

317
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:42,988
Did I put it out?

318
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:45,480
I put it out.

319
00:17:47,187 --> 00:17:48,311
Did I put it out?

320
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:52,522
It was a small fire, not even big enough
to force an evacuation of the hotel,

321
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,571
but definitely big enough
to get us kicked out,

322
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:57,494
and bring Marshall's
bachelor party to an early end.

323
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,995
Is that...?

324
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,014
It is.

325
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:07,757
Hey, guys.

326
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:11,439
How was the fight?

327
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:18,571
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
What happened to the bachelor party?

328
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:21,013
We missed the fight, dinner was ruined,

329
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,224
we spent half the night in the hospital,
and got kicked out of the hotel.

330
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:26,774
- What do you think happened?
- Barney. Barney.

331
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,905
Hey, I was just trying
to be a good best man.

332
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,518
You know what a best man does, Barney?
He does what the groom wants.

333
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:35,639
But all you ever think about is
what you want, what's best for you.

334
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:36,558
Best man?

335
00:18:36,635 --> 00:18:38,860
I'm not even sure I'm inviting you
to the wedding at this point.

336
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,050
You don't mean that.

337
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:43,012
Why should I invite you?
You don't even want us to get married.

338
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,412
That's not true.

339
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:49,054
Lily, don't.

340
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:51,026
What?

341
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,215
I'm sorry, Barney.

342
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,089
It happened last summer
when we were broken up.

343
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:01,259
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

344
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:03,390
- Lily.
- Ah, I got to go.

345
00:19:09,406 --> 00:19:10,913
Newark Airport, please.

346
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:21,166
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Barney, what are you doing here?

347
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:22,908
I can't believe it's really you.
Come in, have a seat.

348
00:19:22,922 --> 00:19:24,706
Do you want some tea?
I know the apartment's small,

349
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:26,679
but I don't need much space.
Let me show you some of my paintings.

350
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:28,859
I think it's some of my best work ever.
Just stop it.

351
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:32,712
Lily, you have to come home.
You and Marshall belong together.

352
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:33,482
The two of you

353
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:36,062
have something that most people search
their whole lives for and never find.

354
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:38,653
I know you love him, and if you knew
what he was going through right now,

355
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:40,993
you wouldn't be here
for one more second.

356
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:43,195
I bought you a ticket home.

357
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:45,736
Marshall is one
of the best people I know,

358
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,885
and it won't be long until
someone else realizes that,

359
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:49,498
and you'll lose him forever.

360
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:51,440
I can't stand the thought
of that happening,

361
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:54,170
and I cannot keep stealing
chicks from him forever.

362
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:58,161
Never, ever tell anyone I was here.
I will deny it tooth and nail.

363
00:19:58,177 --> 00:19:59,670
This trip never happened.

364
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:05,123
Hey, if you had three hours to kill
before your flight, what would you do--

365
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:07,263
Alcatraz or Fisherman's Wharf?

366
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:12,967
You really did that?

367
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:20,881
Marshall, I think Barney's
your best man.

368
00:20:21,674 --> 00:20:22,461
Yeah.

369
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:23,710
Yes, he is.

370
00:20:23,776 --> 00:20:26,192
See, Lily?
This is why I didn't...

371
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:27,943
- Really?
- Really.

372
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,073
Real...

373
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,093
In your face, loser!

374
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:36,707
Take it easy, all right.
Ted's still my best man, too.

375
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:38,518
You guys are co-best men.

376
00:20:38,522 --> 00:20:41,809
Right.
Yes, we're both best man.

377
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:45,791
No, um, seriously.
You guys are co-best men.

378
00:20:45,886 --> 00:20:47,170
Of course.

379
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:58,585
I can't believe you got me this.

380
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:01,727
Oh, I only did it as a joke.
I can return it for you you want.

381
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:05,185
Oh, no, it's okay. You don't have
to go all the way back down there.

382
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:07,406
- I'll, I'll just throw it away.
- Well, I mean,

383
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:08,899
if you were going to throw it away,
maybe I'll take it

384
00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:11,461
in case I get invited
to another wedding shower.

385
00:21:11,475 --> 00:21:14,512
- It's a great gag gift.
- Yeah, it's really funny.

386
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,493
You know who would get a kick out of it?

387
00:21:16,507 --> 00:21:17,481
Marshall.

388
00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:19,473
So, so maybe I'll just hold on to it.

389
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:23,232
I would be embarrassed if Marshall
found out that I bought it for you,

390
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,754
- so I'd better just take it.
- Robin, leave it.
