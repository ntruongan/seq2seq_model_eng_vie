1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:03,577
Kids, never underestimate
the power of destiny.

2
00:00:03,988 --> 00:00:06,408
Because when you least expect it,
the littlest thing

3
00:00:06,418 --> 00:00:08,808
can cause a ripple effect
that changes your life.

4
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,676
Take for instance
my trip to Chicago.

5
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:14,492
That security guard was
a little bit handsy.

6
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:16,385
That's funny.
She barely touched me.

7
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:18,664
Uh, Gate 23. Come on.

8
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:21,263
If we miss this flight,
I will never forgive myself.

9
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:23,824
Why was this flight
so important?

10
00:00:23,854 --> 00:00:26,989
Let's back up a few months
to the fall of 2006.

11
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:29,578
I had just sold my first
building design and become

12
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:32,369
the youngest project manager
in my firm's history.

13
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,606
Suddenly I was
being headhunted.

14
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:38,182
One firm was even considering me to
run their entire New York office.

15
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:40,330
They were flying me in
for a final interview

16
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:42,392
at their corporate
headquarters in Chicago.

17
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:44,339
It was the opportunity
of a lifetime.

18
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:45,781
It was my destiny.

19
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:47,520
There was just one problem.

20
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:49,649
Hi, wait, two more.

21
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:51,492
Sorry, you're too late,
I already shut the doors.

22
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:53,749
Well, I'm sure if we pull
real hard we can open them.

23
00:00:53,764 --> 00:00:56,690
Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but
see, once I close those doors,
that's it.

24
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,852
Nobody else is allowed
down that jet-way.

25
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:01,022
Except for that guy.

26
00:01:02,374 --> 00:01:06,179
Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss
the chance to interview for my dream job.

27
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:07,311
I'm sorry, sir.

28
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:09,520
His dream job!
Didn't you ever have a dream job?

29
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:12,852
Something from when you were a little
girl, that was all you wanted to do?

30
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,029
I mean, for God's sakes,
I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night

31
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:16,632
dreaming about being a...

32
00:01:17,354 --> 00:01:19,001
I mean, uh...

33
00:01:19,386 --> 00:01:21,112
This is a cool job.

34
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:23,911
Please, I have to
be on this flight.

35
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:25,301
I'll see what I can do.

36
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:26,700
But it doesn't look good.

37
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:27,611
Thanks.

38
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:30,449
Your uniforms are pretty.

39
00:01:33,773 --> 00:01:36,273
Sync by vNaru

40
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:49,270
Okay.

41
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,740
They haven't armed the doors yet,
so you still have a chance.

44
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,550
Sure, and for the future,
we recommend you arrive

45
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:01,171
at the airport an hour and
a half before your flight,

46
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:03,121
not, you know,
one minute after.

47
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,799
Normally, I'm
incredibly responsible.

48
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:07,128
I just had to go to court this
morning and get sentenced.

49
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:09,689
Not that I'm a
criminal or anything.

50
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:11,719
Yeah, he just jumped
a subway turnstile.

51
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:15,008
You seem to have a lot of problems
with the rules of travel.

52
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:17,900
Hello?

53
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,729
Oh, that is great news.

54
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:24,831
It's my mom--
she found her missing earring.

55
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:26,840
Have a seat.
I'll call you when I hear something.

56
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,129
Where was it?

57
00:02:29,163 --> 00:02:30,740
That thing better
have call waiting.

58
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:33,321
Could you just call the firm
and explain what happened?

59
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:34,661
It's down to three people

60
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:36,829
and I know they need to
make their decision today.

61
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:40,218
I sort of feel my not showing up
might put me at a disadvantage.

62
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:43,098
I'm so stupid.

63
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:45,211
Why did I have to
jump that turnstile?

64
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:47,910
Hey, don't be so
hard on yourself.

65
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:50,788
And isn't this whole thing
really Barney's fault?

66
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:52,260
She had a point.

67
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,059
It was kind of Barney's fault.

68
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:55,850
Let's back up a few months.

69
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:58,461
Oh, Marshall,
how's the broken toe?

70
00:02:58,473 --> 00:03:00,060
Oh, man, it kills.

71
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:01,658
You want some aspirin, baby?

72
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:03,780
You know I don't
believe in pain killers.

73
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:08,150
Wow, your first broken bone.

74
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:10,050
Kind of kills your whole
"Unbreakable" theory.

75
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,758
Marshall used to think
he was indestructible.

76
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,240
Well, it added up.
I've never broken anything.

77
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,898
I've never been sick,
and when I need to,

78
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:19,401
I can summon
incredible strength.

79
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:22,178
Ted, tell her the story
of the really heavy door.

80
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:24,051
There was a really heavy door.

81
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:25,460
He opened it.

82
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:27,639
On one pull.

83
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:32,160
Well, you must be really bummed, you're
not gonna be able to run tomorrow.

84
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:33,570
Yeah. It sucks,

85
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:36,949
all that work I put in training
for the marathon was a total waste.

86
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:38,891
Training for a marathon.

87
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:41,381
What?

88
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:44,220
You don't need to train for a marathon.
You just run it.

89
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:46,008
You're kidding, right?

90
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,780
Not at all. I could run a
marathon anytime I wanted to.

91
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,728
So like tomorrow, you think you
could wake up, roll out of bed,

92
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:53,509
and just run the New
York City Marathon?

93
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,700
Absolutely.

94
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:57,760
Barney, we're talking
about 42 kilometers.

95
00:03:57,776 --> 00:04:00,218
Thanks, Canada.
I'll take it from here.

96
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:02,370
Barney, it's like 26 miles.

97
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:04,208
Here's how you run a marathon.

98
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:06,829
Step one, you start running.

99
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:09,080
There is no step two.

100
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:11,758
Okay, you know what? Prove it.

101
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:13,758
Take my number and
run in my place.

102
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:17,158
I will bet you 50 bucks you
don't even finish the race.

103
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,509
50 bucks?

104
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:20,398
Gee, Grandpa, if I win,

105
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,951
maybe I can buy myself
an ice-cream cone.

106
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:25,581
Make it $10,000.

107
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:27,941
You have a gambling problem.
You'll bet me 50.

108
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:29,419
Fine, then no bet.

109
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,901
Okay, $50.

110
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:35,668
The next morning,
as the marathon began,

111
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:37,869
we were focused on
Marshall's computer.

112
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:40,441
Each runner gets a tracking chip
so you can follow them online,

113
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:43,448
see when they pass certain checkpoints.
Barney's got mine in his shoe.

114
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:45,409
Ooh, he's starting!

115
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:47,360
This ought to be good.

116
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:53,769
Wow.

117
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,891
He's already passing
the second checkpoint.

118
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:59,300
This tracking thing is amazing.

119
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:01,658
When we get married,
you're getting one of these.

120
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:10,429
Wow. Look at his time.
It's pretty impressive.

121
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:12,541
He's gotta be cheating, okay.

122
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:13,760
He knew we'd check.

123
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:15,378
Yeah, he'll do
anything to win a bet.

124
00:05:15,393 --> 00:05:18,839
Remember that time he bet me that Men
at Work sang "Hungry Like the Wolf,"

125
00:05:18,855 --> 00:05:21,449
and when he found out that they didn't,
he tried to hire them to?

126
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:24,890
Well, it looks like, "Barney" should
be coming over the Queensboro Bridge

127
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:28,138
and up First Avenue within
the next hour or so. But...

128
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:30,691
there is no way that
that's really him.

129
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:32,171
It's really him.

130
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:41,791
Hey! That's mine.

131
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,900
Yeah, you'd better run!

132
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:50,129
- What up, non-finishers?
- Wow.

133
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:52,430
- Very impressive, Barney.
- Right?

134
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:54,270
Yeah, my time would have been
like a half an hour better,

135
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:57,261
but I met this total hottie on
Mile Seven. We took a quick detour

136
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,831
and had our own mini
marathon behind a Nathan's.

137
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:01,031
I won.

138
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:04,619
I'm not sure anyone in
that story is a winner.

139
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,890
So where's my 50 bucks?

140
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:09,179
All right.

141
00:06:10,193 --> 00:06:13,180
I got to admit,
you earned this.

142
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:17,978
Huh? Can't believe they haven't
made a coin for this yet.

143
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:19,987
Anyway, I'm heading home.

144
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:21,928
Might go hit the gym.

145
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,835
Oh, hey, just so you know,
uh, all marathon runners get

146
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:26,558
to use the subway
for free today.

147
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:29,930
Wow. You know I really should
check out this "subway."

148
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:31,300
Heard so much about it.

149
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:33,680
Wow. Look at me. Slumming it.

150
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:36,539
Maybe I'll make a
weekend out of it

151
00:06:36,556 --> 00:06:39,028
and I'll call my bridge
and tunnel girl tonight.

152
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:41,129
You're dating a girl
from New Jersey?

153
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:42,471
No.

154
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:47,701
So Barney did it.

155
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:49,158
He actually finished
the marathon.

156
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:52,608
But a little while later...
I got an interesting phone call.

157
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:54,321
- Hello?
- Ted, it's Barney.

158
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,750
Listen to me, I need you to come
and pick me up on the subway.

159
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:58,491
What, what are
you talking about?

160
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:01,401
I was sitting here,
totally minding my own business.

161
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:08,888
Finisher.

162
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:12,020
Yeah, you know what I mean.

163
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:14,018
86th street.

164
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:37,869
My legs don't work.

165
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:40,898
I've already ridden the
subway twice end to end.

166
00:07:40,913 --> 00:07:42,988
I've seen where
it turns around.

167
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:46,478
Ted, you don't ever want to see
where the subway turns around.

168
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:50,090
Barney's legs won't work.

169
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:51,708
He's riding the subway
from end to end

170
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:53,878
because he physically
can't get off the train.

171
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:55,871
Best 50 bucks I ever spent.

172
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:57,331
Listen to me, Ted.

173
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,330
I'm going to lose you any second.
I'm on the fourth car of the six train

174
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,648
heading south from Pelham
Bay Park in the Bronx.

175
00:08:02,663 --> 00:08:05,571
Meet me at the 86th Street station in,
like, half an hour?

176
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,690
All right. I'll be right there.

177
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,250
Stay where you are.

178
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:12,110
Ted, Ted.

179
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:33,479
Oh, come on. You're not even going
to give up your seat for him?

180
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:37,630
I'm sorry. I can't.

181
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:38,981
Douche.

182
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,635
- Barney?!
- Ted!

183
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,123
Hey!

184
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:06,895
No...!

185
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:10,785
See? If Barney never
tried to run the marathon,

186
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,532
you never would have
jumped that turnstile,

187
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:14,575
you wouldn't have had
that court date today,

188
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,285
and we would have
made this flight.

189
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:17,583
You're right.

190
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,442
Everything can be
traced back to him.

191
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,382
Like that rash we
all got at Christmas.

192
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:25,112
All right,
I have to see what's going on.

193
00:09:26,238 --> 00:09:29,124
- So I was able to get you two seats.
- Really? That's great!

194
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:31,994
No, no, not you. I'm talking to
my mom about Blue Man Group.

195
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:33,404
Ma, can I call you back?

196
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:35,495
Okay, what about our flight?
Can we get on?

197
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,893
I'm still waiting for... Huh.

198
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,163
Looks like your
flight left already.

199
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:42,792
What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no.
I have to be in Chicago today.

200
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:44,322
Well, he never even
called you back?

201
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,924
Well, it's typical pilot.
They don't call you back at work

202
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:49,022
and they don't call you back after
you spend two nights with them

203
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,743
at a Radisson in Orlando.

204
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:57,871
It turned out there was one other
flight that would just barely get me

205
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:00,253
to Chicago on time
for my job interview,

206
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:02,851
but it was all the way on the
other side of the airport.

207
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:04,884
What was the name of
the airline again?

208
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,744
I think it was something
like Flights R' Us.

209
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:07,861
Was the "R" backwards?

210
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,204
God, I hope not.

211
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:12,631
- Geez.
- Stupid smart carts.

212
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,872
More like dumb carts.

213
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,281
If we miss this flight,
it's all Barney's fault.

214
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:20,812
You know, Barney never would have
run the marathon in the first place

215
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:23,121
- if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.
- Yeah, so?

216
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,304
What, you think
this is my fault?

217
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:30,781
For Marshall, the initial idea to run
the marathon came way back in April.

218
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,821
My pants are starting
to feel a little tight.

219
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:36,424
Oh, that's okay.
I love that cute little belly.

220
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:43,124
I cannot allow this.

221
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:44,324
What?

222
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:49,632
I am going to run the
New York City Marathon.

223
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:02,241
"It is important to load
up on carbohydrates

224
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:05,201
two to four hours
before a big run.

225
00:11:05,217 --> 00:11:07,583
Try a breakfast of a bagel,
a banana,

226
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:10,554
oatmeal, strawberries
and some orange juice."

227
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:13,301
Here you go, Marshmallow.
Just like the book said.

228
00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:17,131
Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating
all of my breakfast runner-style.

229
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:19,062
Liquids are digested faster.

230
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,084
That way, no energy is wasted,

231
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:23,744
and it's all about the run.

232
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:57,883
"Don't forget to give yourself
plenty of positive reinforcement."

233
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:01,022
This is gonna be
your best run yet.

234
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:05,494
You're going to accomplish
all of your goals.

235
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:08,982
You are a robot sent
from the future

236
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:10,901
to win the marathon!

237
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:15,053
You are... Marshall.

238
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:18,844
You are... Marshall.

239
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:23,054
You are Marshall! Yeah!

240
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:32,301
"Chafing or blisters can
occur in a number of areas,

241
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:35,932
including the feet, armpits,
or even the nipples.

242
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:39,851
Try using some petroleum
jelly on the affected areas."

243
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:01,223
Oh, gosh!

244
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,632
Dude, you are a
terrific runner.

245
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:23,601
Tomorrow you're gonna run and
finish the New York City Marathon!

246
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:25,643
You're the best.

247
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:27,833
You look good.

248
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:31,791
Nobody does it better than you.

249
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:33,441
Marshall? Oh, my God!

250
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:37,072
So, yes, it was your fault.

251
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:39,351
I mean, if you don't show up at the
apartment in the middle of the day,

252
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:42,043
Marshall doesn't break his toe,
Barney doesn't run in his place,

253
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:43,911
I don't jump the turnstile
and get a court date,

254
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:46,173
and we make our flight
in plenty of time!

255
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:51,051
And I don't fall down and bite
my tongue at the airport.

256
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,841
That really wasn't my fault.

257
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:55,401
I wouldn't have walked in on
Marshall if it weren't for Lily.

258
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,811
Hey, think about it.

259
00:13:57,557 --> 00:13:58,822
Hey, what's going on here?

260
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,873
Oh, looks like they're
camping out for something.

261
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:02,202
Yeah, but for what?

262
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,443
I don't know. Usually there's a
Stormtrooper or Klingon in line

263
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,172
to give you some indication.

264
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:09,002
"Annual wedding dress blowout.

265
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:12,173
Designer sample
dresses up to 90% off.

266
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:14,244
Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m."

267
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:18,381
Oh, my God. Can you believe what some
nut bags will do to save a few bucks?

268
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:20,544
We have to camp out.

269
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:22,423
- Are you serious?
- You don't understand.

270
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:24,843
This is an amazing sale.
I've heard about it before,

271
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:26,844
but I never knew where it was.

272
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:30,451
We'll have a wedding dress campout.
It'll be fun.

273
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:32,722
I can't go.
I've got this thing.

274
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:34,912
- What thing?
- A penis.

275
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:38,821
- This is the place.
- Oh, wow.

276
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:41,912
Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet!

277
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:43,193
Vera Wang!

278
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:47,271
Oh, Robin, do you have any idea
what you guys stumbled onto here?

279
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:49,031
You said wang.

280
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:55,444
Oh, this reminds me of the ticket
line to Lilith Fair, 1998.

281
00:14:55,457 --> 00:14:57,251
Only fewer mullets.

282
00:14:57,268 --> 00:15:02,044
You should feel good. You're only, like,
the tenth craziest bride in New York.

283
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,982
Ooh, this is comfy.

284
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:09,453
We might actually
be able to sleep.

285
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,551
That's kind of annoying.

286
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:16,823
Well, I'm sure somebody will be
out here to turn it off any minute.

287
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,461
I don't think I can take this.

288
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,922
Every time it turns off,
I think,

289
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:36,922
oh, maybe it won't
turn on again,

290
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:39,153
but then it does.

291
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:40,682
Why does it, Robin?

292
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:42,871
Why does it keep turning on?

293
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:44,923
It's gonna be okay,
sweetie. Why...

294
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:47,701
Why don't we make a
game out of it, okay?

295
00:15:47,716 --> 00:15:49,274
Why don't we sing along?

296
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:12,002
If we get through this,

297
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:15,483
I swear I'm gonna live
my life differently.

298
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:19,791
I just want to tell my parents
I love them one more time.

299
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:23,092
Morning, ladies.

300
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:28,053
- It's him. It's the car guy!
- Get out of here!

301
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,692
The next morning, Robin was too tired
to go all the way back to Brooklyn,

302
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,024
so while I was at work,

303
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,602
she went to crash at my
apartment for a couple hours,

304
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:46,924
and that's when...

305
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:49,401
Nobody does it better than you.

306
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,062
Marshall?! Oh, my God!

307
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:55,622
So if Lily hadn't dragged me
down to the wedding dress store,

308
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:57,331
we would have made
the first flight.

309
00:16:57,388 --> 00:17:00,022
Oh, thank God.
The doors are still open. We made it.

310
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:04,131
Hi. Please.
We really need to get on this flight.

311
00:17:04,248 --> 00:17:06,204
Oh, my God!

312
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:08,632
You're that reporter
from Metro News 1.

313
00:17:08,646 --> 00:17:10,391
Yes, yes, I am.

314
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:12,371
I can't believe
you recognized me.

315
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:14,781
- You did that story on the giant pizzas?
- Would you check to see

316
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,114
- if you have any more seats?
- One moment, sir.

317
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,094
Were those pizzas real?
Come on, were they?

318
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:22,332
- Robin...
- One second, Ted.

319
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,414
Um, you know,
a lot of people ask me that.

320
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:26,743
The truth is,
the pizzas were real.

321
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:29,824
- Calzones. Trick photography.
- I knew it!

322
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:32,824
God, it is so nice
to meet a fan!

323
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:36,151
And I would be a fan of your
work if you could get us

324
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,852
two seats on that next flight.

325
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:42,712
Well, the, uh, flight attendants are
just finishing up their final
seat count.

326
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:44,651
Let me see what I can find out.

327
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:47,381
Would it help if I got on and gave an
impassioned speech about my destiny?

328
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:48,921
I think it might hurt.

329
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:54,342
This is such a nightmare.

330
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:58,474
Okay, so we agree? This goes
back to Lily wanting to camp out

331
00:17:58,556 --> 00:17:59,781
for a wedding dress?

332
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:01,581
No.

333
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:03,604
Wait. It goes back further.

334
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,553
Remember why we were eating
hot dogs on the East Side?

335
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:19,181
1939?!

336
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:22,244
This penny's from 1939!

337
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:27,034
A 67-year-old penny.

338
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:29,964
Do you realize this penny was
minted during World War II?

339
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:33,291
Oh, so was my grandfather,
but that doesn't make him interesting.

340
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,102
Look, I know a little
something about coins,

341
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,144
and this baby is worth
something to a collector.

342
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,291
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

343
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:42,594
You know what?
I'm gonna take you out to dinner

344
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:44,334
with the money I get
for this little guy.

345
00:18:44,347 --> 00:18:46,802
And that's exactly what I did.

346
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:50,423
You're lucky there's still a place that
serves anything for a dollar fifty.

347
00:18:50,437 --> 00:18:53,491
Hey, that's 150 times
its original value.

348
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:57,043
Actually, the meal
was only $1.49.

349
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,561
1984.

350
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:02,371
Hey, in 50 years,
we can get dinner again.

351
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:03,934
How dare you.

352
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,843
Hey, what's going on?

353
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:07,532
I don't know. Looks like they're
camping out for something.

354
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:09,034
Yeah, but for what?

355
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:11,232
It was me.

356
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:13,162
I started this.

357
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:15,092
If I hadn't picked
up that penny,

358
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:17,971
we wouldn't have gone to get hot
dogs all the way across town.

359
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:20,431
And we wouldn't have seen
that wedding dress store,

360
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:22,394
Lily wouldn't have wanted
to camp out there,

361
00:19:22,407 --> 00:19:25,612
and I wouldn't have needed a nap
at your apartment the next day.

362
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:27,871
Marshall wouldn't
have broken his toe.

363
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:30,032
Barney wouldn't have
run the marathon.

364
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:32,054
I wouldn't have jumped
that turnstile,

365
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,571
gotten arrested,
had that court date...

366
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:36,653
And we would have
made our flight.

367
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:39,333
I don't think we can go
back any further than that

368
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:41,081
unless you know who
dropped the penny.

369
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,512
I wish I did.

370
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:44,412
Though that person's already
been punished enough,

371
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:47,112
losing a sweet penny like that.

372
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,994
Uh, sir?

373
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:51,704
Oh, please tell me you
have some good news.

374
00:19:51,717 --> 00:19:53,512
Uh, I'm afraid not.

375
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,583
There are no extra
seats on the plane.

376
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:56,882
I'm sorry.

377
00:19:56,899 --> 00:19:58,754
All, right, well,
thanks for trying.

378
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,773
I can't believe this.

379
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:03,563
That's it, it's over.

380
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:05,081
Ted, come on.

381
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:08,473
Your destiny just wasn't to
make it to Chicago today.

382
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:11,421
Anyway, if that firm really wants you,
they'll reschedule.

383
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,294
But that's not what happened.

384
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:15,102
They didn't reschedule.

385
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:16,984
They hired someone else.

386
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:19,532
And as it turned out,
three months later,

387
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:22,822
that guy ended up having
to relocate to Chicago.

388
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:25,211
Kids, funny thing
about destiny--

389
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:27,691
I thought I was destined
to get that job.

390
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:29,024
But I was wrong.

391
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:31,604
My destiny was to
stay in New York.

392
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:33,864
Because if I hadn't,

393
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:36,023
I never would have
met your mother.
