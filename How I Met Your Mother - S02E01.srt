1
00:00:00,568 --> 00:00:02,415
Okay where were we?

2
00:00:02,415 --> 00:00:04,362
It was June of 2006,

3
00:00:04,362 --> 00:00:06,659
and life had just taken
an unexpected turn.

4
00:00:06,659 --> 00:00:09,729
Dad, can't you just skip ahead
to the part where you meet Mom?

5
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:12,084
I feel like you've been talking
for like a year.

6
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:14,700
Honey, all this stuff
I'm telling you is important.

7
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:16,226
It's all part of the story.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,287
- Could I go to the bathroom?
- No.

9
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:23,426
The summer of 2006
was both wonderful and awful.

10
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:25,490
For me, it started out great.

11
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:27,524
In fact, day one was amazing.

12
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:29,780
I'd finally gotten together with Robin.

13
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,365
But while I'd been off having
one of the best nights of my life,

14
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:37,672
your uncle Marshall had been having
one of the worst nights of his.

15
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:42,420
So that's it?

16
00:00:42,597 --> 00:00:43,681
We're breaking up?

17
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:46,183
Marshall, I'm sorry.
I just...

18
00:00:46,457 --> 00:00:49,470
I just need to go to San Francisco
and do this art program and

19
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:52,422
-and figure out who I am outside of us.

20
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,792
And the only way
that I can do that is if...

21
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,661
if we don't talk for a while.

22
00:00:59,455 --> 00:01:00,552
For a while.

23
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:03,233
Try never, okay?

24
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:06,041
You walk out that door,
and we're done.

25
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:08,731
You're never going
to hear my voice again.

26
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,433
I should call her.

27
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:11,900
- No, No.
- Ted it is--

28
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:14,223
If you call her when she asked you not to
you're just going to look weak

29
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:15,533
and you're going to regret it.

30
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:19,450
Now, listen, whenever you feel like
calling her, you come find me first.

31
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:21,910
And I will punch you in the face.

32
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:24,353
You're a good friend, Ted.

33
00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:27,682
Hey.

34
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:29,013
So, did you hear the big news?

35
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:31,193
You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up,

36
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:34,693
and Lily's gone and nothing else
even remotely important happened last night,

37
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:36,431
yeah, I think he knows.

38
00:01:36,455 --> 00:01:37,722
Oh, my God.

39
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:39,912
I-I'm so sorry.
Wh--

40
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:41,070
What happened?

41
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:43,143
Well, she left.

42
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,762
And I don't even know
if she's coming back.

43
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:47,870
I didn't get your message until I woke up.

44
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:50,460
- Bro, I am so sorry.
- Thanks.

45
00:01:50,596 --> 00:01:52,140
I know it must be tough,

46
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:55,420
but are you ready to hear something
that will not only make you feel better,

47
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:57,452
but will actively excite you?

48
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,663
Sure.

49
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:04,982
For the first time, ever, the three of us
are single at the same time.

50
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:10,011
I've dreamed about this day, boys,
and it's going to be legendary.

51
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:12,701
Together, we will own this city.

52
00:02:13,108 --> 00:02:17,140
Anytime a girl wants to get back
at her ex-boyfriends,

53
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:18,720
we'll be there.

54
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:22,621
Anytime a girl wants
to solve her father issues

55
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:26,801
through promiscuity and binge drinking,
we will be there.

56
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:31,200
Anytime a bachelorette party
drives through the city in a limo,

57
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:33,281
sticking their heads out
the sunroof shouting,

58
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:34,823
"What's up, New York?"

59
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:38,112
we will be what is up New York.

60
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:41,581
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on...

61
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:48,941
Aw, man, you guys did it, didn't you?

62

63
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:07,501
One thing I learned that summer
is that when love is beginning...

64
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:14,781
...and love is ending,
the first 30 days are remarkably similar.

65
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:18,391
For one thing,
you spend most of your time in bed.

66
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:25,420
Your friends can't stand to listen to you.

67
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:31,132
It was a really beautiful song.

68
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:35,310
So... stupid, man.

69
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,903
And you never seem to wear pants.

70
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:46,002
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hey, Ted.

71
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:47,271
You hungry?

72
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:49,093
What's the point?
I could eat some food.

73
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,052
It's just going to leave me.

74
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:54,071
Well, at least in that scenario
you get to do the dumping.

75
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,872
Come on, it's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.

76
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:00,550
Lily always made the pancakes.

77
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:03,180
God, I loved her pancakes.

78
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:06,121
So soft.
So warm.

79
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:08,212
So perfectly shaped.

80
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:10,771
Are we still talking about her pancakes?

81
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,232
Come on, you got to eat something;
what can I get you?

82
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:16,942
- Beer.
- No, that's what you had for dinner.

83
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,390
Fine.

84
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:20,582
Then I'll just have leftovers.

85
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:26,301
So, he stays home all the time
not getting laid?

86
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:29,273
No, see, that's what you do
when you have a fiancée.

87
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:32,372
He should be down here celebrating.
He's free.

88
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:34,942
He got that redheaded tumor removed.

89
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:37,913
You should write
and illustrate children's books.

90
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:40,332
You know what Marshall needs to do.

91
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:42,821
He needs to stop being sad.

92
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:47,003
When I get sad, I stop being sad
and be awesome instead.

93
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:48,902
True story.

94
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:51,523
It's only been a month.

95
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:53,122
He just needs to go at his own pace.

96
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,331
Anyway,  Lily's the one
who caused this whole mess.

97
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:56,891
Hey, cut her some slack.

98
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:59,763
She's our friend, too.
She's just trying to figure out who she is.

99
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:00,962
Figure out who she is?

100
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,982
Yeah, she should call me;
I got a whole list.

101
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:05,972
She's selfish.
She's immature. She's...

102
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:07,470
What?

103
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:10,103
God, your eyes are so blue.

104
00:05:11,307 --> 00:05:13,241
Teddy Bear.

105
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:18,222
Oh that's a...

106
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:28,122
Yeah, it was hard to feel too bad.

107
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:31,670
I was dating the woman of my dreams,
and things were going great.

108
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,120
Well, for the most part.

109
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,031
So, I found her shampoo.

110
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:36,551
I guess she left it here.

111
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:38,433
It smells like her.

112
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,972
Like lavender and seashells and hope.

113
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:51,461
Somehow, erotic and comforting
all at the same time.

114
00:05:52,957 --> 00:05:54,331
That's  my shampoo.

115
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:57,132
Oh, sorry.

116
00:05:57,346 --> 00:05:59,681
Mmm, I thought he'd never go to sleep.

117
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:03,493
- Uh-oh.
- Already?

118
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:06,890
He's calling her.

119
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:09,811
- I don't hear any--
- He's calling her.

120
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,073
No.

121
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:15,132
Okay, you're right,
I won't call her.

122
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:17,421
I will not call her.

123
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:19,542
Well, I called her.

124
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:23,150
And get this, she changed her number.

125
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:25,192
What, like I'm going to stalk her,
or something?

126
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:27,191
Like she's so special.

127
00:06:27,197 --> 00:06:29,153
Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there.

128
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,070
'Cause there are four others
in the San Francisco area alone,

129
00:06:32,078 --> 00:06:34,012
and they all seem a lot better than her

130
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:36,531
based on the brief conversations
I had with them.

131
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,663
- Does he know I'm in here?
- Yeah, hey, Robin.

132
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:43,000
- Anyways, one of the Lily Aldrins said...
- This has to stop.

133
00:06:43,108 --> 00:06:44,821
Ted, we just started dating.

134
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:46,553
We agreed we don't want to move too fast,

135
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:48,481
and yet somehow, we have a baby.

136
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:50,232
He can't feed himself.

137
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:53,992
- He cries a lot, he keeps us up all night.
- Have you tried breast-feeding?

138
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:55,273
Nailed it!

139
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:58,153
Look, they were together nine years.

140
00:06:58,155 --> 00:06:59,921
It's  only been a month and a half.

141
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,662
He just needs to go at his own pace.

142
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,153
He slept on our floor last night, Ted.

143
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:08,122
- He watched a scary movie.
- It is time for some tough love.

144
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,004
We need to get him out of that apartment.

145
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:12,560
He needs fresh air.
He needs sunshine.

146
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:14,995
Mmm, sunshine.

147
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:19,111
Gentlemen, please welcome
to the stage, Sunshine.

148
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:25,823
All right, I really don't think
this is going to help.

149
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:28,593
Do you know why
you're not over Lily yet?

150
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:30,753
It's 'cause you can still
picture her naked.

151
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:33,923
You can't get over a woman until
you can no longer picture her boobs;

152
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:35,200
it's a scientific fact.

153
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:41,460
The average male brain can only store
a finite number of boob images or "b-pegs".

154
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:44,843
And your hard drive's
filled to capacity with Lily's.

155
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,403
There are a lot of them.

156
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:49,843
Well, they won't go away
until you overwrite them

157
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:51,572
with images of other women's boobs.

158
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:55,523
Now, this journey may take
as many as a million boobs,

159
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:57,923
so we begin here tonight, my friend.

160
00:07:58,037 --> 00:07:59,393
Two at a time.

161
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:01,513
Those count as four.

162
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:07,171
Yeah.

163
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:10,132
This is fun right?
We're outside, it's a beautiful day.

164
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:12,073
The Indians are winning.

165
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:15,100
I got to admit,
it is really nice to be outside.

166
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:18,921
Yankee fans, please turn your attention
to the Diamond Vision for a special

167
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:21,580
- seventh-inning-stretch surprise
- Oh, no.

168
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:31,852
It's all a big lie!

169
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:34,113
She's just going to break your heart.

170
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:39,650
You can drag me out of here,
but she has no soul!

171
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:42,261
We've tried everything--
baseball, strippers.

172
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:44,340
The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.

173
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:46,011
I think he's beyond repair.

174
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:47,900
See, this is the problem with guys.

175
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:49,532
You don't know
how to deal with heartbreak.

176
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:52,172
Oh, and what's your prescription,
Dr. Estrogen?

177
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:55,881
Eat Haagen-Dazs and watch Love Actually,
till your periods sync up.

178
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:04,173
Yeah, that's the stuff.

179
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:05,742
Oh, my God.

180
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:07,412
How long have you been doing this?

181
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,791
Well, my dad taught me to shoot
when I was a kid.

182
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:12,332
Whenever I'm feeling lonely
or depressed, I come here,

183
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:15,722
and it reminds me that... guns are fun.

184
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:23,012
Um, you know,
Ted is kind of against guns.

185
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:25,863
And that's why
Ted's never going to find out about this.

186
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:29,751
Whoa, that sounded kind of scary
with me holding a gun, didn't it?

187
00:09:29,758 --> 00:09:32,120
No, I-I just mean, please don't tell Ted.

188
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:33,951
You want to try?

189
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,453
Only hell yeah.

190
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,562
Oh, yeah, yeah, this is what I needed.

191
00:09:40,035 --> 00:09:43,310
I felt so powerless this whole time,
but this...

192
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:46,712
this is power.
This is...

193
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:51,243
I should of mentioned the recoil.

194
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,720
I got to hand it to you, when he got home,
Marshall was smiling--

195
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,011
did you sleep with him?

196
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,860
'Cause I was actually, like,
three days away from suggesting that.

197
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:02,210
Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch
with your feminine side.

198
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:08,253
- Yeah, yeah!
- Well, congratulations.

199
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:10,413
You're the first person
to cheer him up all summer.

200
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:12,171
- You win.
- Oh, what do I win?

201
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:14,461
I'll tell you what you win:
I'm taking you away this weekend.

202
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:16,422
You are?
That's so nice.

203
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:18,493
Yeah, my aunt and uncle
have a beach house out in Montauk,

204
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:19,922
oh, it's really romantic.

205
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,941
My uncle's had like three affairs there.

206
00:10:22,118 --> 00:10:25,793
Wow, must be a nice house,
I've seen pictures of your uncle.

207
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:28,632
This is going to be so great.

208
00:10:28,638 --> 00:10:30,421
We'll finally get some time alone.

209
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:32,832
Are you sure Marshall's
going to be okay with this?

210
00:10:32,838 --> 00:10:35,993
Yeah, absolutely.
Dude, I'm doing much better.

211
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,810
In fact, take my car.

212
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:38,810
- Really?
- Yeah.

213
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:40,572
Hey, thanks... and, hey,

214
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:42,873
if you need anything day or night,
just call me--

215
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,693
You know what, please don't call me.

216
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:47,272
What? What's wrong?

217
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:49,671
It's, uh, Lily's credit card bill.

218
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,970
She must have forgotten
to switch her address.

219
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:52,743
So?

220
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,453
So, I wonder what kind of charges
she's making out there in San Francisco.

221
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:58,660
No. No, no good can come
from looking at this.

222
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:00,911
- You've made too much progress already.
- I know but I just, maybe the--

223
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:01,742
No!

224
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,391
You're going to thank me for this.

225
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:09,440
You're a good friend, Ted.

226
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:13,581
August 5th, one charge-- tickets.

227
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:17,672
To what? George Clinton
and the P-Funk All-Stars.

228
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,550
August 10th, one charge: Tennis Emporium.

229
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:25,030
August 18th, two charges: Mario's Bistro

230
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:27,913
and, get this, Pet Palace.

231
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:31,150
You guys see what this means, right?

232
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:36,201
Wow, Mario's Bistro.

233
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:39,110
What a perfect place to whore around.

234
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:41,672
Only the best for my little Lily pad.

235
00:11:42,557 --> 00:11:47,061
Oh, funk legend George Clinton,
I am so glad you spotted me at your concert

236
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:50,790
and dragged me on stage to dance
with you Courtney Cox-style.

237
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:53,531
And I'm so glad you agreed
to play tennis with me.

238
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:58,121
You know, Marshall tried to get me
to play tennis for nine years,

239
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,573
but I didn't do it,
because I never truly loved him.

240
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:04,100
I got you a gift.

241
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:07,920
Oh ! A ferret.

242
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:11,782
Oh, I'll buy it some food next door
at the Pet Palace.

243
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:14,432
Oh, I've always wanted one,

244
00:12:14,437 --> 00:12:17,383
but Marshall had
this secret phobia of ferrets.

245
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:20,280
I bet that's something
he made you promise not to tell nobody.

246
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:21,900
It was.

247
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:23,663
Oh.

248
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,491
I love you, funk legend George Clinton.

249
00:12:26,835 --> 00:12:28,510
I love you, too, Lily.

250
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:31,162
That's right, Marshall, she's all mine.

251
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:32,911
Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.

252
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,810
# Ow, we want the funk. #

253
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:36,840
# Give up the funk... #

254
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:38,723
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

255
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,373
Yeah, why are you afraid of ferrets?
They're adorable.

256
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:44,430
Because, Robin,
they're like fuzzy, tube-shaped rats.

257
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,252
Plus, those charges are from,
like, a month ago.

258
00:12:47,255 --> 00:12:47,893
Exactly.

259
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:50,050
For new charges,
you have to go to her online account.

260
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:53,271
You  can see credit card activity from,
like, two hours ago.

261
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:57,582
But, you know, don't.

262
00:12:59,976 --> 00:13:02,602
Why do you talk?
Why do you talk?!

263
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:05,481
He needs her password.
It's not like he has her password.

264
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,383
Ooh, this is good, he has her password.

265
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:12,270
There's a charge from earlier today:
the Kellett Hotel on 5th.

266
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:16,250
I don't believe this.
Lily's back in New York.

267
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,600
I can't believe this.

268
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:23,283
Lily's in New York?

269
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:26,601
I-I guess I've been thinking
when she got back, she'd call me.

270
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:30,472
That's really the only reason I've been able
to hold it together so far this summer.

271
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,412
This has been "holding it together"?

272
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:34,831
Okay, you know what?
I'm calling her.

273
00:13:34,836 --> 00:13:36,132
- No.
- Ted, give me the phone.

274
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:37,512
You're not calling her,
this changes nothing.

275
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,832
You, come here.

276
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:42,541
Look, while we're away this weekend,
can you keep an eye on him,

277
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:44,100
make sure he doesn't call that hotel?

278
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,453
You want me to babysit him?

279
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:46,863
20 bucks.

280
00:13:47,195 --> 00:13:48,081
An hour.

281
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:49,381
And money for pizza.

282
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:53,011
Uh, yeah, how about you do it for free or
every time we hang out, you have to watch this?

283
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:53,830
Come here.

284
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:56,731
- My little blue-eyed baby, baby lips.
- Ooh, ooh, sugar, sugar...

285
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,461
Okay,  I'll do it!
Stop being a couple.

286
00:14:01,285 --> 00:14:03,091
- Marshall.
- Marshall, Marshall!

287
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:04,912
Ted, I know I shouldn't do this,
but I have to!

288
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:05,551
- You call her...
- We were together...

289
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:06,841
- for nine years!
- ...and everything we've been working so hard for

290
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,113
is completely flushed down the toi...

291
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:10,150
Hello, Lily Aldrin's room, please.

292
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:12,222
Thank you.

293
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:14,042
- Hang up now.
- Ted, I can't hang up now.

294
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:14,940
- Hang up now.
- The missiles are in the air,

295
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:16,423
- and I know that you don't approve.
- Hang up.

296
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:17,041
Hello.

297
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:24,951
Uh, a guy answered.

298
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,602
There's-there's a guy in her room.

299
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:31,871
- I'm going down there.
- Dude, you can't do that.

300
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,753
I have to go down there,
and I have to tell her I love her;

301
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:35,231
I have to beg her to take me back,

302
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:36,611
even if I have to get down on my knees.

303
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:38,722
- Marshall, you can't do that.
- Oh, really, why not?

304
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,482
56 days.

305
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:42,940
That's how long it took me
to get right about here.

306
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,893
Because you're pathetic!

307
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:49,803
I'm sorry, but right now,
you are not Marshall.

308
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:54,982
You are the miserable, whining,
shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall,

309
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:58,321
and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have
a shot in hell with a girl like Lily.

310
00:14:58,537 --> 00:15:01,110
You know who might have a shot
somewhere down the line.

311
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:02,602
Marshall.

312
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:04,130
The real Marshall.

313
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,002
But if you go down there
right now like this,

314
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,640
you're going to blow it for him,
and he's never going to forgive you.

315
00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:12,191
Of  course, whatever I say,
you're just going to do the opposite, so

316
00:15:12,197 --> 00:15:14,731
have a great weekend.
Good luck screwing up your life.

317
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:15,871
Come on, Robin.

318
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:22,320
Is it still okay if we borrow the car?

319
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,571
Bold. Bold to go for the car.

320
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:31,162
What?

321
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,233
I didn't say a thing.

322
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:35,482
You think I was too hard on him.

323
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:37,072
I didn't say a thing.

324
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:39,392
I can't believe you're accusing me
of being too hard on him.

325
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:40,880
You're the one who said "tough love."

326
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:43,431
Yeah, tough love,
not "hand the guy a noose."

327
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:45,562
Oh, but it's okay
to hand him a nine millimeter?

328
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:48,850
Yeah, he told me.

329
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,632
So you're a gun nut?

330
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:54,662
No, I'm a gun enthusiast.

331
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,150
- Do you know how many people...
- The Second Amendment...

332
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,650
- are killed each year in accidents...
- protects my right to bear arms...

333
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,712
All right, all right, all right.

334
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:01,313
I was too hard on him.

335
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,673
A little.

336
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,762
I'm going to call Barney,
see how they're doing.

337
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:10,770
Go for Barney.

338
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:12,101
Oh, hey, where are you guys?

339
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:15,733
We're at a fundraiser, helping young women
raise money for community college.

340
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:17,101
Strip club, nice.

341
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:18,443
Is Marshall okay?

342
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:20,661
Yeah, he's here and he's great.
Uh, hang on.

343
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:22,193
Marshall?
Tell Ted that--

344
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:24,613
Uh-oh.

345
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:25,721
Already?

346
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:28,271
What? What uh-oh?

347
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,692
He's gone.

348
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:30,892
You lost him?

349
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:32,933
I can't believe this.
He's gonna go down to that hotel.

350
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:35,411
Crap, you're right. Okay, okay,
here's the plan, here's the plan.

351
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,500
You go down to the hotel and find him.

352
00:16:37,506 --> 00:16:39,602
I'll stay here and get a lap dance.
On three. One, two...

353
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:40,472
Barney!

354
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:48,291
Was there a hot tub at your uncle's place?

355
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,063
A really nice one.

356
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,662
Hi, uh, could you tell me
what room Lily Aldrin's in?

357
00:16:58,757 --> 00:16:59,693
Marshall.

358
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,200
Hey.

359
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:04,331
What happened?

360
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:07,973
Well, I went up to Lily's floor,

361
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:09,991
and I had this little speech in my head--

362
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:14,731
everything I've been wanting to say to her
all summer about love, loyalty, respect.

363
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:16,382
I knocked on the door.

364
00:17:22,726 --> 00:17:25,210
So you knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?

365
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:26,112
Yeah.

366
00:17:26,397 --> 00:17:27,912
It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.

367
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:29,541
What? Who-- who was it?

368
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,412
His name was Joey Adalian,

369
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:35,022
although he went by a number
of aliases in his years as an identity thief.

370
00:17:35,426 --> 00:17:37,272
Apparently, earlier in the summer...

371
00:17:37,637 --> 00:17:40,731
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

372
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:43,051
I-I could have sworn I had some change.

373
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:46,010
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

374
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:48,212
Oh, here we go.

375
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:50,703
No, that's-that's a button.

376
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:52,322
It was a button.

377
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:58,392
- Do you, uh, take credit cards?
- Yes, I do.

378
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:02,480
So Lily's not back in town,
and she doesn't have a boyfriend?

379
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:03,913
Th-That's good news, right?

380
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:04,791
Yeah.

381
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:06,981
I don't know.

382
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:11,692
Those credit card charges were the only
remaining connection I had to her.

383
00:18:12,878 --> 00:18:15,800
I don't know where she is
or what she's doing.

384
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,600
She was my whole life, man,
and now she's-she's gone.

385
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:27,872
You know, first day of college, I showed up,

386
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:33,170
I was so freaked out, and-and I got up
to my room, and there was my roommate,

387
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:36,283
lying on the bed
with his feet up on the wall.

388
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:40,621
Had headphones on, big smile on his face
like he just didn't give a crap.

389
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:42,470
Happy.

390
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:43,820
Confident.

391
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:45,421
Not afraid of anything.

392
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:47,891
That guy was you.

393
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:50,383
You before you met Lily.

394
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:53,490
Ted?

395
00:18:53,927 --> 00:18:54,812
Yeah?

396
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:57,232
I was high that day.

397
00:18:57,757 --> 00:19:00,382
I was. I was so high,
I thought you were the dean.

398
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:10,102
Wh-What I'm saying is there's a version
of you without Lily, and it's not this.

399
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:15,452
You can't let Lily steal your identity
the way that guy stole hers.

400
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:18,863
Okay.

401
00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:22,251
Okay, resolved.

402
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:25,942
Starting tomorrow,
I'm going to start being okay.

403
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:28,143
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

404
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:39,040
But he wasn't,
'cause that's not how life works.

405
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,590
The next day,
he found one of her socks or something,

406
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:43,382
and we were back to square one.

407
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:47,863
And then, one morning...

408
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:50,301
Ted, I think you should see this.

409
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:52,650
Oh, no, what now?

410
00:19:54,506 --> 00:19:56,993
Marshall, what are you doing?

411
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,653
It's Sunday.

412
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:00,733
It's pancakes day.

413
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:10,232
It took him 67 days and
one really disgusting batch of pancakes...

414
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:16,333
So good.

415
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:18,093
So good.

416
00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:21,251
...but Marshall
had come back from the dead.

417
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,342
Because while baseball, strippers,
and guns can help,

418
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:28,443
the only thing that
can really heal a broken heart is time.

419
00:20:28,448 --> 00:20:31,081
# I try to laugh about it #

420
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:34,631
# Cover it all up with lies #

421
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:39,471
# I try to laugh about it #

422
00:20:39,478 --> 00:20:43,112
# Hiding the tears from my eyes #

423
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:49,701
# 'Cause boys don't cry. #
